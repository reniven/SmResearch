INSERT INTO `text` VALUES (63729,'\nWeather or not to ban guns. The answer is obvious, if we do ban guns wouldn’t criminals be the only ones who are able to have guns and citizens would not be able to have access. I am clearly against banning guns in order for self to defend and protect my rights as a citizen. If the law were to come in affect the wiliness for others to protect themselves or to have security upon danger would be difficult.\nThe ban of guns will more likely create a whole new victim group. It would prevent legal gun ownership but it wouldn’t prevent illegal gun ownership. Gun crimes with illegal weapons are commonplace. If police can use weapons to defend themselves from criminals; wouldn’t you want your own protection as well? Criminals and gangs are able to still have access to illegal guns, and to ban guns from honest citizens is taking a privileges they earn in order to protect themselves and their family. Gun owners have the advantage to combat and survival. If the ban of guns were to come into affect, gun owners now would doubly turn in their weapons.\nThe real question is would you be safer if guns are banned.  In Washington and New York there is several gun controls laws but yet these two are ranked high in having the most murders, Washington being the murder capital of the United States. Especially now a day, terriost attacks and incidents have been happening all around the world lately and to be prepared and protect is the key to any good turn out.\nIn conclusion, overall banning guns wouldn’t be the best step in our government it will cause a huge controversy and will more likely create a whole new argument. It wouldn’t stop the access of illegal guns and I think that’s been the focus should be on. It would prevent legal gun ownership but it wouldn’t prevent illegal gun ownership, which is the problem.'),(63730,'It depends on what country. I think gun control should be a thing, but on certain conditions. If someone has no history of mental illness and no criminal record beyond drink driving and the occasional parking ticket, than by all means allow them to purchase a low-powered rifle or pistol. The issue arises when people can have multiple weapons registered to them, when in places like the United States have this gun culture, and when proper control of the sale and distribution of weapons is not properly cared for.\nWith all of these school shootings throughout the United States in the past few years, I think guns are the issue. Not the entire issue, obviously, because you can have a hundred guns, but it takes a special kind of mental state, stable or not, to be able to kill someone without a very good reason. All of the people responsible for mass shootings and murders will usually have some sort of severe mental problem. However, it\'s this gun culture that the United States has that makes it all slightly more okay than it would be in most other countries.\nGuns should not be banned in the United States, or indeed anywhere. People keep guns for hunting and for recreation, and protection, among other things. However, this gun culture means that someone will have eight guns, two sons with major mental issues and an entire community perfectly willing to go hunting without a single worry. With the gun culture that the States has, it all seems a little easier when someone wants to go on a murderous rampage. That\'s why most other countries have so few in comparison. If it\'s issues with population, look at China.\nSo, I think guns should definitely be controlled, especially in the United States. However, I can understand that people can use guns for recreation, hunting and sport. So, I think that people should be allowed to have guns on the condition that they have no mental issues or history of violent crime, and that none of their immediate or close family or friends have them either. Then, with this sort of control implemented, there should be a lot less shootings throughout the United States.'),(63731,'There is too much gun violence in America. It has been going on way too long. It is time to have strict gun control in this country.'),(63732,'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a startling revelation for 2015. It is projected that deaths from guns will surpass deaths from car fatalities in 2015.

US/Somalia like gun laws doesn\'t.'),(63749,'Then why would banning them be a good idea? Think before you post stupidity.'),(63750,'It greatly reduces shootings of all kind, crime related to it, it saves a huge amount of money.'),(63751,'The United States has the most violent crime involving firearms in the entire world. They aren\'t the highest-populated country in the world, nor do they directly suffer from the most war or the most oppression, and they still have the biggest gun problem and the most deaths from firearms. More people are killed in home invasions by guns they keep in their home, and most teens shoot up a school because of a combination of mental issues and weapons their fathers keep in their home, or that of a friend.'),(63752,'Second Amendment, baby! .'),(63753,'Yes make it so people can be controlled by the government more great idea ;)'),(63754,'Guns shouldn\'t be banned because then the people who follow the law won\'t be able to protect themselves from the ones who don\'t.'),(63755,'what about UK? 40 times less gun crime ... so fuck you :D'),(63756,'Think about it. It\'s not the 60s anymore. Thousands or Russians aren\'t going to go marching up the street and slaughter your family. Most shooting deaths in home invasions are caused by the guns of the owners, taken by the burglar, either when they have found it in their house or when the owner of said gun has tried to protect themselves with it and had it turned on them. Sure, even if guns are outlawed violent crime will not stop. But it will still be the same amount of violent crime, less home invasion deaths and less school shootings. Like I said, think about it.'),(63757,'US/Somalia like gun laws doesn\'t.'),(63868,'Loads of debate raging after the mass killings in the past few months\non one side are those who want to ban autmatics and semi - automatic assault style weapons that fire multiple bullets per minute...some also want to tighten the application process for gun licenses\non the other side many americans point to the second amendment and claim it entitles them to buy and use and weapons they like\nthen theres some in the middle of the road who believe in the second amendment right to bear arms but simply think the 200 bullets per minute assault weapons should be banned and only available to soldiers\nthe crime figures are interesting\nobviously gun murders in america are way higher per head than any developed nation in the world (11000 ddeaths compared to european nations who average around 40 per year in total)\nbut pro gun people point that other crime stats are often higher in some of these other nations, such as robberies , common assaults, etc\nso what do you think?'),(63869,'I doubt the founding fathers who wrote the 2nd amendment were thinking about the kind of guns we\'d have in 2013.

By this sentence you and me have different defenitions of punishment it seems.\nI could own a hundred assault rifles and people around me would still be safe.\nNot necessarily if you have no safety training. Or are a criminal/psychopath who bought their guns from a gun show.\n\nIt doesn\'t necessarily, whether or not anyone who is able to purchase guns are fucked up in the head or a hardcore criminal or untrained with access to higher grade weapons do.\n\nBecause guns back then are not nearly as powerful as they are now, also you could legalize every gun in the world it will make practically no difference against tanks, soldiers, and military style aircraft.'),(63874,'Punishment is when I can\'t have something because someone else screwed it up for everyone else. Why don\'t we just punish the criminals? That\'s the real problem. The problem is not people owning assault riffles. The problem is crazy people. Figure out how to identify the crazies and keep them from owning guns.\nAs far as tanks and military aircraft..., how long have we been fighting radicals in both Iraq and Afghanistan?

Also we restrict people from any freedoms, murder can be seen as a \"freedom\" and illegalizing that has done more good then bad in my honest opinion.

If I wanted to tie what I wrote to banning automatic weapons or tightening gun laws I would\'ve done that.

Joe was talking about simply owning an object. You compared that to (presumably) maliciously and deliberately destroying the property of others. It was just such an incredibly unfair comparison I felt the need to point it out. I think a better comparison would be cars or knives, perhaps.\nOn the individual level do nuclear bombs have any purpose other than unquantifiable levels of destruction? You\'re either not using the nuke or you\'re using it to blow up several square miles and that\'s really all you can do with a nuke. Guns can be used and are regularly used for hunting, entertainment, and self-defense. That makes guns at least about as practically useful as cars or knives and hugely more practically useful (and less destructive) than a nuclear bomb. I think you\'re making another unfair comparison. Like:\nWe don\'t let people have cars. Sure, a responsible person could have a car and not hurt people, but why take that chance? We determine it is not worth the risk.\nExcept for we do let people have cars (it\'s a regulated process, like firearms) even though they kill loads of people ever year. When you compare like with like you\'re point seems to have less impact.\n\nCool, that\'s about where I\'m at with gun restrictions, too.\n\nI assume you\'re talking specifically about automatic guns, again? If you are I agree. Really the gist of my post was pointing out that owning a piece of property and going around destroying other peoples property are not the same thing at all. One is the simple act of owing a weapon, the other implies malicious intent to destroy, which is both not the same thing at all and very unfair because the connotation is all gun owners are malicious destroyers.\n\nAnd the most, because they know they can handle it. My roommate for example is a highly intelligent, self-made successful, reserved, modest, driven, educated (and for all intents and purposes mentally stable) city boy with a family history of military service and extensive experience and interest in firearms. He takes owning, handling, and using his guns (he has several) very seriously and he takes proper care always as the result of his proper training. A lot of my gun-owning family members are very similar to this. I know many people like this besides him. Maybe it\'s just where I\'m living but I know more stable, safe gun owners than not. In fact I can only think of two bad gun owners off tops. And it seems to me with all the gun owners in this country if people were really all that mentally unstable and paranoid there would be a lot more death than what we have now. But what we have now is the vast majority of gun owners chillin with their weapons, not shooting up invisible helicopters or - god forbid - schools. So again it seems incredibly unfair of you (unless you have some tangible statistics on the general mental stability and paranoia of gun owners - which very well might exist) to generalize people who own firearms as nutjobs defending against paranoid hallucinations because they\'re all so horribly mentally unstable.'),(63928,'This was the argument I was answering.

You\'re entire explanation of why my post was a straw man is essentially that it is off topic (\"was not addressing the same subject as me or what joe originally said.\"); being off topic doesn\'t make an argument a strawman, it makes it off topic. As for it not being on topic, well, it addressed the point you made, referenced the point joe made, and then explained why joe\'s argument worked and why yours didn\'t. If that\'s not on topic I don\'t know what is.\n\nYes, but his example didn\'t infringe on the happiness of others and yours did, which is why it was an unfair comparison and that\'s why I felt compelled to say something along those lines. He\'s talking about property he can own that would make him happy; you are talking about destroying the property of other people to make you happy. A.) those are not the same thing at all and a completely pointless comparison and b.) using the premise of the pursuit of happiness your example also fails because it relies on impacting the happiness of others for your own happiness while joes example only impacts joes happiness.

The right to bear arms never included nor was intended to include unregulated arms or even unlimited arms. Regulation was and always was a key element of the amendment.\n3.

Here is why:\n\"Mental Instability\"\nHalf of a given population will experience mental illness in their lifetime, and in any given year roughly a quarter of the population is diagnosable with mental illness. One in seventeen live with a chronic mental health condition. Most of these people are not violent, and if they are it is not necessarily because of mental illness. In fact, those with mental illness are actually more likely to be victims of violence than those without mental illness, and are less likely to be perpetrators than victims. There is no research that I am aware of that indicates an actual causal link between mental illness and violence; this is an unfounded stereotype that negatively stigmatizes those living with mental illness.\nTo deny equal rights to people who have done nothing wrong, who are more likely to be victims, and who we have no actual reason to suspect will become violent is entirely unethical. This is especially true if you extend the restriction to any and all mental instability.\nAnger issues, alcoholics and drug addicts\nAnger issues I am more inclined to agree with, although assessing and screening for that is questionable in terms of efficacy. What constitutes an \"anger issue\"? Is it established by psych eval, criminal history, etc?\nExcluding alcoholics and drug addicts I take more issue with, as again these populations are not to my knowledge actually demonstrably proven to be more violent (and, again, may actually be more likely to be victims of violence given concurrent patterns of poverty or homelessness).\nFundamentalist Cults or Religion\nWho defines what constitutes fundamentalist? Do the beliefs really matter, or do we care if they are identified as gang or terrorist organization that actually supports and encourages violence? This standard seems exceptionally dangerous, as a punishment of freedom of speech, belief, and association.\n\nI have absolutely no idea what state you live in, but in no state that I have lived in are you required to get either a physical or mental exam for a drivers license.\nAt any rate, psych exams are pretty easy to lie out of and don\'t really screen very well in my opinion. Accurate diagnosis are rare even with people who have been working extensively for an extended period of time with a trained professional.

Now that said there are certain complications with implementing either idea. Implementing gun control of course reduces the availability of deadly firearms to those who could possibly do harm. However illegal drugs are of course illegal and yet they are still produced and imported enmasse into America from its borders so its safe to say that a ban on domestic guns will just increase the demand for illegal firearms to be imported so criminals can still get them with relative ease. However without gun control, domestic guns become easier to ascertain but there are more civilians armed in any given area. For instance a gunman enters a mall and opens fire on the people inside. In an ordinary shopping mall numerous people will have a concealed firearm on there person at any given time. Now imagine that mall security is being held up by fleeing people that leaves those with concealed weapons to neutralize the threat. Guns are good for some and bad for others. I think we need to look into the weapons used in shootings and see if they are stolen or bought with a license. Most likely they are obtained illegally meaning that no matter what regulations you put in place those with bad intentions will still obtain firearms. that being said, our best hope for preventing more tragedy is arming those good citizens to act like a hidden police force to hopefully neutralize threats before they can cause considerable harm.

Pools are significantly more dangerous in the home than a gun is.\nWhat about the most dangerous machine in history? The automobile. We should make cars safer.

This is our right. Nobody can take away our rights. Now for the more complicated aspects. Cities in America where gun control is the strongest have the most gun killing because a criminal is a criminal and doesn\'t care for the law. Also when a criminal know that nobody can defend themselves against a gun they are going to feel that they can attack and get away with it. Where I live it takes twenty to thirty minutes for a police officer to come out here. In those twenty minutes a lot can happen especially since both my parents work and me and my sister stay him alone a lot. My house has been a target for many years and we know that. That\'s why when I was twelve I was taken out not only to learn what a gun can do but how to use one. I now am a sharp shooter but the guns aren\'t where I can get them easily. If I were attacked while my parents were gone I would release my dogs after my attacker and bust the door into my parents bedroom where I would find the guns. All of this would be done after I called the police but since it will take them twenty minutes a criminal would have a lot of time to act against me. I am seventeen now and I still know how to defend myself and have been the scary situation where someone tried to break on my house while I was alone. I was too young to understand guns because I hadn\'t been taught yet and let me tell you I was terrified. Older I feel more secure with a gun locked in my parents bedroom. Huns should be given out freely to the people so we can not only have our right but so we can protect ourselves. The door on my house is no longer locked for my protection but for yours.'),(188922,'If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. Do I need to draw you a picture?'),(188923,'Wholly unregulated gun control is entirely illogical and inadvisable.

If you point me to something more specific I can clarify.\nHonestly, I think guns are largely a matter of secondary importance and receive more attention than they merit so I have not given great consideration to the details.

My stance is less nuanced on this issue than on others given my relative weighting of its importance, but I do still have an opinion on it.\nThe argument against absolute deregulation seems apparent to me (correct me if I am wrong). With respect to the particular regulations I would support - training, licensing, and non-defensive/non-hunting firearm prohibitions - I consider the benefits of restriction to outweigh the harms. We require training and licensing for the possession and/or use of other potentially dangerous or deadly objects (e.g. cars and driving, chemical handling, etc.), and that we should want to know who possesses a firearm and be relatively confident that they possess the knowledge of how to wield it responsibly makes sense to me. Regarding non-defensive/non-hunting firearms, I see no compelling reason why anyone needs guns outside of those uses and the risks of allowing ownership outweigh the obscure potential benefits (albeit that the risks are, as already mentioned, a secondary problem to the root causes that generate them to begin with).\nDoes this clarify adequately?'),(188930,'Obviously, but this is about gun confiscation actually, which I should have stated I guess but uh yeah...\nAnyways, the only regulations there should be is a background check and a safety course.\nAnd a psychological screening somehow maybe.'),(188931,'Yes, you probably should have. Confiscation similarly has logical applications and is not a clear cut either-or question, in my opinion.\nBackground checks, safety course, and stricter restrictions upon non-defensive and non-hunting firearms.\nPsych screening I oppose because it is ineffectual and problematic independent of the gun issue. Furthermore, restricting the rights of individuals because they have a diagnosable condition rather than because they have done anything seems wrong to me. Additionally, those with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators (and are more likely to be victims than those without mental illness).'),(188932,'The psych screening they would look for is what Delta Force look for in military snipers, and they are 2 things to determine if you qualify or not, but only 1 of them applies to civilian issues.\nWhen Delta Force selects their snipers, they look for two things to avoid. One is called the \"Texas Tower Syndrome\" referencing charles whitmans massacre of 14 people.\nThis characteristic manifests itself when a person starts shooting and can\'t stop because it feels so good, such a sense of power, that he can\'t turn it off once his target is eliminated and will continue to shoot anyone in sight.\nThe second thing they avoid is an emotional attachment to the target. But that is not important when we are talking about a citizen defending themselves.\nSo we should look for the TTS in people, and this can be screenede easily by going to the firing range and seeing who empties their clip the fastest.'),(188933,'Is there any evidence that this is actually an accurate and effective predictor for behavior in screening? Even if it is, I suspect that the process for identifying TTS is more complex than simply booting out whoever empties their clip fastest. To accurately screen on a psych basis you would need someone trained in psychology, and limited resources make it likely that in implementation the screening conductor would be improperly prepared to make their assessment.\nFurther, while eagerness and enjoyment of discharging a firearm may be one potential warning sign it is not uniformly the case that those exhibiting it would abuse their firearm right. It is also true that those predisposed to abuse that right may exhibit no warning signs whatsoever, either because the signs are missed or because they are not evidenced at the time of acquisition. Again, you will deny equal rights to individuals on what seems to me a vague and inaccurate basis.\nMay I presume since you failed to respond to my other points you either agree or don\'t care enough to dispute them?'),(188934,'I don\'t know, I got it from the book Inside Delta Force written by Eric L.

Gun crime consistently goes down when there is not access to guns.\nThe point of controlling guns, what recent debate about, is not prohibition.\nIt is accepted that people for whatever reason want guns.\nThe debate is about the number of bullets and the power of the gun. When you limit this less people die. That is a fact. A school shooting by some nut will result in less deaths when they have less bullets and less powerful guns. This is a fact.\nSo there are two elements at play.\n1. A citizen with an automatic weapon designed for war zones is useless for hunting, self-defense, or anything accept playing around on a range.\n2. These guns are used in mass shootings resulting in more deaths than would occur if these guns designed specifically for war were not available.\nThe logical conclusion is to limit these guns and the size of the magazines. You still get a gun if it makes you feel better, so no need to cry, it\'s just limiting the size and power in order to save lives.\nAll of these arguments against it are incredibly selfish and frankly tragic.

In our case our economy has improved over this time, the opposite of England and Europe\'s economy.\nSo the murder rate rising cannot correlate with economic depression in our case. See why you cannot make a direct comparison?\nIn the last three years gun ownership has increased though, a lot. Other things which have increased include paranoia, distrust of government, and fear for future, disconnected from an improving economy. This mentality leads to more people who should not have guns seeking guns, and they then use those guns to kill people. This is a prime reason for the increased murder rate over the last three years.\nBetter gun control makes it easier to keep guns out of the hands of crazy people. Limiting ammunition and the power of the gun means that when someone who is crazy does get a gun, they are able to kill less people. So you are saving lives two ways.\nMeanwhile, the sorts of criminals who are dissuaded from carrying out a criminal act due to the fear of guns are no more or less dissuaded whether the person has a hand gun with 6 bullets or an AK47.

Every once in a while England adds more laws and murder goes UP immediately, then goes down but back to levels even or higher than where they were. England has a century of steady growth when it comes to murder rate, so it has nothing to do with their economy.\nAmerica\'s murder rate has been going down, your CCP statistics are wrong.

You\'ll notice a decrease I\'ll bet after 1997. Your numbers are taking a snapshot of rates in the 80s and comparing them to the current condition, meanwhile in between there were rises and dips. The point is recent rises have to do with poverty.\nYou are trying, it seems, to make a connection in between gun regulation and an increase in gun deaths. Let\'s think about this though. By this logic you are saying that defending against gun deaths by pulling out your six shooter Dirty Harry like is something that happens enough to be statistically relevant. This of course is a silly notion. We know that the cases of defending against murder via gun is rare because those driven to the point of murder are not thinking about consequence in that moment.\nIt\'s a none issue.

The irony is the fear spread of something which did not exist has convinced many that the thing which did not exist should, better regulation of guns.\n\nTrue, but it happens yes?\n\nVictims in many ways, I agree. But not victims of random shootings I\'d say. So do you believe that in answer to their victimization we should supply crazy people with guns?

I would say that\'s a win-win for both sides.

However, if focus can be placed on the why, what, when and how through conversation, we may be able to move beyond gridlock.'),(227453,'There are currently approximately 32,000 yearly gun related deaths in the united states. This has increased by 4,000 yearly since the year 1999, not only should this number NOT be increasing it should be DECREASING. The fact of the matter is that gun violence is an escalating issue within our country that we must address. Background checks, limitations on bullet magazine sizes, and types of weapons sold legally MUST be used to reduce the death and destruction that is caused by loose control on guns.\nThere are various case studies that clearly demonstrate the efficacy of increased gun regulations on the level of deaths within a country. After an outbreak of gun violence in the 1990s, the Australian government legislated broad bans on guns and strict regulations on their possessions. These included the need to demonstrate a \"genuine purpose\" for the ownership of small arms, air guns, and paint markers, and a \"genuine need\" for other weapons such as pump action or semi-automatic rifles. Weapons such as assault rifles, full automatic rifles, or missile launchers were banned from civil distribution completely. Fifteen years later gun violence has dropped significantly, most notably it dropped by 47% the year after the legislation\'s inception and 30% the next year. The buyback of guns by the government has been linked to a 75% drop in gun suicides. The journal of law and economics reports today that the laws have caused a total reduction of 59% of gun deaths since 1995. Before the laws came into place there were 13 gun massacres in Australia, since then there have been none. In japan it takes weeks of complicated paper work to acquire a permit for a gun.The new york times reports that In japan there were 11 gun deaths in 2012 versus 30,000 in the united states. Adjusted for populations that is one death for every 11,600,000 people as opposed to approximately one death for every 10,000 people in the united states. As Michael Bloomberg said \"We are the only industrialized country in the world with this problem. in the whole world, the ONLY one.\"\nThere is no tangible reason for the opposition to background checks or any other form of regulation on the legal holding of firearms. A comprehensive background check on individuals who would like to purchase guns would not affect them other than to bind them legally to their actions with those weapons. Since people who are buying weapons for self defense or hunting or recreation have no reason to be stopped from purchasing guns then they will not be affected. Despite a majority of the developed world having strict gun laws and comprehensive checks on the individuals using them, those countries have not fallen into the distopian autocratic dictatorship which the NRA and conservative pundits like to imagine. Clearly in countries where armed civilians are completely illegal whether as weapons or not, such as Egypt, the citizenry has been able to overthrow their oppressive governments. All of which would never occur in the united states because it is an operating democracy with actual (believe it or not) representation of the populace.\nCurrent gun laws within the united states are woefully inadequate and equipped to deal with the problem of gun violence. Numerous examples, many of which you have probably heard of, exist in which mentally unstable people have been sold firearms or have acquired them easily and then caused massive death and sorrow. Most notably THIS WEEK a military specialist undergoing psycho-analysis for symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and who had been listed as \"At Risk\" for a psychotic break, purchased a .45 caliber pistol at \"guns galore\" (the same store that sold guns to the shooter of fort hood in 2009) and opened fire on a military base. This resulted in the injury of 16 people and the death of 4. This is a perfect example of how a simple background check would have identified this individual as unable to purchase a weapon and therefore discouraging his violent break. In addition this negates the ridiculous and genuinely offensive argument that had people had MORE weapons there would have been a Hollywood style gun fight in schools or in public and by some miraculous and illogical feat of luck the attackers would have been neutralized by civilians without any deaths or consequences. Not only does this suggest that having open gun fights in public is acceptable and PREFERABLE to the current situation, it is also completely devoid of thought or consideration for the actual victims in a situation. Shockingly the assailant shot up a military base filled with trained soldiers and still managed to kill and injure people before escaping, driving to another building and killing more people before killing himself.\nThe fact is that firearms, and the laws(or lack thereof) regarding them, are facilitating the death of thousands of people within the united states. Gun regulation, in conjunction with education and public health laws, must be used to help alleviate the problems that face our solemnity. There is no need to significantly affect legal and responsible gun owners however, the loose sale of firearms is irresponsible and dangerous.'),(227454,'Request for general firearm and violence source citations.\nDo you have specific citations for any of the statistics you have reported? I am curious to know whether the research investigates correlation or actually controls for mitigating variables to establish a causal relationship between particular gun control measures and reduced firearm violence.\nRequest for specifically mental health related source citations.\nI am also interested to know what knowledge you actually possess around the issue of mental illness as it relates to prevalence and relative proclivity towards violence. Given my research and your relative lack of statistical references around your particular points on this matter, I am led to suspect you are jumping to conclusions about this particular relationship.\nMy research on mental illness and violence, and the case against screening against mental disorder for firearm permits.\nThe Facts:\n26.2% (1 in 4; 816,100,000) of Americans live with a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year; roughly 6% (1 in 17; 18,800,000 people) live with a serious, disabling mental disorder (source).\nDespite this, roughly 60% of adults and 50% of youths do not receive mental health services (source).\n\"Mental disorders are neither necessary nor sufficient causes of violence. Major determinants of violence continue to be socio-demographic and economic factors. Substance abuse is a major determinant of violence and this is true whether it occurs in the context of a concurrent mental illness or not. [...] Members of the public exaggerate both the strength of the association between mental illness and violence and their own personal risk\" (source).\n\"[...] too little is known about the social contextual determinants of violence, but research supports the view the mentally ill are more often victims than perpetrators of violence\" (source).\nThe Argument\nScreening for a history of mental illness as part of the background check for a firearms permit is a misguided attempt to curtail gun violence.\nFirstly, there is no actual causal relationship between mental illness and a propensity for violence that is any higher than in the general population.\nSecondly, the screening process would miss most individuals diagnosable with a mental illness to begin with given poor treatment rates in the nation; it is would definitely miss those not having sought care who are the ones most likely to be unstable (presuming the link between mental illness and violence actually existed to begin with).\nThirdly, you are penalizing and restricting the equity of a quarter of the population based on a misconception of mental illness and in pursuit of what will be an ineffectual policy.\nFourthly, without entering into a debate about the actual relative success of the use of fire-arms in self-defense I would claim that individuals have a right to choose to carry in their own defense and that by extension those more at risk to violence have an even stronger claim (in fact, other nations with stronger restrictions include increased risk of violence as a basis for having a legitimate reason to request an ownership permit).\nFinally, it is positively reprehensible that the only thing galvanizing mental health care reform in the decades of systemic neglect is the misdirected and prejudicial attack on the those living with mental illness; it is, of course, far easier to falsely target a group than to actually address the real issues in our society.\nAlternative Suggestion for Curtailing Firearm Violence\nActually target the root causes of gun violence. Certainly, basic background checks for an actual history of violence (rather than unreliable, prejudicially assumed predictors of violence) are reasonable. There is also no real reason why anyone needs to own anything that could be used for something other than self-defense or hunting. Beyond that, however, violence will continue to happen regardless of the weapon used unless we actually address the true causes of violence. As noted in the research I cited, the most predictable variables for violence are socio-demographic and economic. Addressing poverty and economic insecurity would be a far more successful tract to addressing violence. Setting aside unfounded assumptions and investing in further research into other actual causes of violence that differentiate the U.S. from other nations (or make it comparable) would also be a worthy direction.'),(227455,'I stopped reading after your first 2 sentences were impossible.

Also the idea that \" a crazy person with knives\" will kill even close to as many people as a person with a fully automatic assault rifle or even a pistol not only lacks common sense, but is separate to the argument.\nI am actually from colombia, I have done extensive research into the problems that our country faces. The past two decades have seen an incredible rise in violence and organized crime due to the influx of the illegal drug trade and partially the united states drug code and policies(its not all the u.s.\'s fault, just partially,). The statistics of gun deaths in colombia are impossible to unpack from the environmental situation and therefore are completely incomparable to the united states or any other industrialized nation.\nSwitzerland operates a citizen militia and therefore requires its citizens to train with firearms constantly. it also has a GDP per capita of 46,000 which is higher than the u.s., as well as 25% of the population holding a higher degree and 99% of the population being able to read and write as opposed to the u.s. ~80%. The federal department of justice and police also did a case study in switzerland and determined that the reason for it\'s high immigrant crimminality rate was due to the countries large acceptance of political assylum seakers who arrived with little education, no knowledge of a modern economy, and no ability to operate in an industrialized nation. In addition to all this which skews the statistics in fact switzerland has a comprehensive regulation of fire arm sales. To purchase a gun in a commercial shop one must have a \"Waffenerwerbsschein\" or weapons acquisition permit that includes a phsyciatric exam and a full criminal records check. in order to buy a weapon from an individual a check from the crimminal records bureau is needed. breech loading or muzzle loading rifles can be bought however suppressors, automatic weapons, selective fire weapons, and certain accessories such as large ammunition holders is completely prohibited.\nThe revolution in germany was under completely different circumstances. After the end of the war the democratic Wienmar republic was the governing body that took control of germany, this had a terrible system and ineffective rulers. The reperations that germany had been forced to pay were so large that the government literally did not have enough cash to pay them, they therefore decided to print more money, This spiraled into a vicious circle of runaway hyper-inflation in which a couple billion german Marks couldnt buy a loaf of bread. Famine, crime, death and destitution ensued causing a complete wipe out of the middle class and the reduction of population and living standard of what was previously the most industrialized nation in the world. The loss of the middle class causes an inherent radicalization of the populace, the middle class has an active stake in the stability of a political system within a country, the lower and upper classes not as much. Therefore hitler, who was an opportunist as well as a political and oratorical genius, took control democratically. However, a similar situation will most likely never happen in the united states, and brandishing our assault rifles in preparation for a day that will never come is illogical and wasteful as well as pessimistic and borderline insane.\nI find your comment about Mubarak hilarious because the only reason he stayed in power was due to heavy american aid and political support.

Guns have no place in society and much and all as I love the USA and its marvellous people I don\'t like guns . No other passage in the US Constitution is as hotly debated as the Second Amendment. In full, this controversial sentence reads:\n“A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.”Although most people focus on the “bear arms” part, the real key word is “militia.” The thing is, in 1791, no-one really knew if this whole “Union” thing was going to work out. Many of the States distrusted each other, and everyone distrusted big government. The possibility of invasion was frighteningly real, and the Second Amendment was put in place to make sure that a citizen’s militia could defend the principles of the constitution. What the Second Amendment didn’t do was grant any drunken asshole the right to stagger into a gun shop and buy an assault rifle without a single background check. In 1939, the Supreme Court even ruled that:“The Second Amendment must be interpreted and applied with the view of its purpose of rendering effective Militia.”By 2008, they’d extended that to cover self-defense in the home—something else that doesn’t require a high-capacity magazine and the ability to kill everything within a three block radius. But that’s all they’d extended it to: there’s no constitutional “right” to carry a concealed weapon, no “right” to use armor-piercing bullets—just the right to defend yourself against intruders. And as Stephen King famously said: “if you can’t kill an intruder with ten rounds, you need to go back to the shooting range.”'),(227653,'Reasonable gun control. Comparing hitler and stalin to gun regulation is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen.'),(227654,'Gun violence in America is an anathema. Gun control is imperative.'),(227655,'We have gun control.\nNow, I suppose the argument from gun control advocates is as scattered as arguments from gun advocates. There is little to no consensus on either side on what level of gun control is \"right.\"\nHere are some things to note, however. The weapon used at the Elementary School and Movie theater was an AR-15. It is a semi-automatic assault rifle. As assface has pointed out in an earlier debate, this weapon is no more dangerous than your standard hunting rifle. It doesn\'t \"spray\" bullets. Automatic weapons are not the most tactical nor are they the most reliable. The military rarely even uses automatic weapons. It really does depend.\nSo killers, either trained by the government or just lunatics, tend to not use automatic weapons. Automatic weapons are for non-skilled people who would rather unload a magazine and make sure they hit their target. They are also for people like me, who enjoy guns as a novelty. And they are even for hunters, who are about killing the shit out of their prey.\nIn general, when it comes to preventing these horrendous mass murders, going after automatic weapons is pointless. Going after all assault rifles is only in the right track if you get rid of all hunting rifles as well. However, assault rifles are RARELY used in gun related homicides. Handguns are. Handguns, in fact, are the most dangerous type of guns, for they are easy to conceal and not as expensive. However, they are the most reliable for women who need to fend off attackers for they are small and easy to use (depending on the handgun, of course.) Assault rifles are big and bulky, very difficult to conceal, and for a woman being attacked not very accessible or usable. In general, your average American prefers handguns because of its affordability and easy to carry. You are allowed to keep a handgun on your persons in states with right-to-carry laws, which is good for people whom are afraid of being attacked in dark alleys or other areas where they are at risk.\nSo what kind of gun control would prevent a mass murder like what we\'ve seen in the past few years? If we had a nationwide ban of all guns, it\'s possible that it would be difficult for lunatics, especially those who aren\'t very well-connected, to get their weapons right away. A killer like John Holmes wouldn\'t have been stopped, for he definitely knew his shit (considering how he even rigged his entire apartment with explosives, which I will get more into detail later,) however the recent murder at the Elementary school could possibly have been prevented. Or, it would have merely delayed it. Best case scenario, the kid would have only killed his family and maybe only a few kids. Some of them would have possibly escaped, considering he didn\'t lock the door. In total, we could have seen a few less deaths overall, or maybe none of them could have died. It\'s very possible that this kid would have not been able to chop up or beat the life out of these kids after doing it to his family, since it is far more intimate to use blunt or sharp weapons than guns.\nBut what about explosives? They are not hard to come by, especially if you have a copy of the Anarchist Cookbook. This kid might not have been able to make devastating explosives, but John Holmes did. He didn\'t use them to kill those people at the theater because he had his AR-15, a grim but important fact to note. Now, rigging an entire theater to blow MAY take time, but not that much time. Maybe he could have gotten caught, but if not he would have killed even more.\nAnd then we look at the murders at Virginia Tech. roughly 30 killed with handguns.\nSo an all out ban and \"War on Guns\" is really the only thing we could try to prevent shootings. Explosives would become the new weapon of choice for people hoping to get a lot of kills in short times, but as a country I suppose we\'d deal with it then.\nHowever, maybe disarming the populace isn\'t the best choice.\n1. No guarantee that this will work. Prohibition rarely works in this country, and guns are pretty much everywhere in this country. There is little to nothing we can do to get rid of the guns that are already here. Not only do guns get smuggled in here, we smuggle guns everywhere else. America is a major gun nation, and a \"War on Guns\" would be a full-scale war that may be even more detrimental than the War on Drugs. Especially since we have enough trust issues with our police and military.\n2. Disarming the populace won\'t necessarily make the people safer. People have used guns in self defense for many [different cases]. More people use guns for self-defense than they do for murder. A dick load more. It\'s very easy for a murderer to use a knife instead of a gun, for murder tends to be by surprise. Guns for self-defense, on the other hand, are either in fire-fights or something of the such. Not to mention it\'s a lot harder to apprehend someone if you only have a knife, especially if you know nothing about knife fighting.\nI had more reasons, but this is pretty long already.\nSo what CAN we do to prevent these massacres? Two main things, luckily:\n1. Loosen gun control. Gun free zones are basically areas where you can\'t defend yourself or your family. School shootings are terrible and scary, but fear of the guns instead of the people doing the shooting is more of a problem than the tools of murder. If teachers were armed, they\'d be far more likely to prevent a school shooting... like in Israel. Israel is a more dangerous place, so they keep their teachers armed. It has proven to be of good results. There\'s the fear of unstable teachers, but that\'s all it is... fear. Fear, the thing that keeps us from protecting ourselves. If a teacher wants to kill his kids, he\'s not going to listen to the \"gun-free\" rule put in place. However, another armed teacher could prevent him from doing too much damage. It\'s more of a fact, that the greatest threat to a mass murderer is another person with a gun.\n2. Focus on the Psychology of these people. We focus so much on shifting blame, be it gun control, violent video games, or heavy metal, and we never think about the fact that these people were unstable and created by society in the first place. there are probably so many preventative measures we could have made in raising our children or spreading media that would stop these spree killings, but instead we seem to only provoke it by spreading the fear and paranoia. A lot of these people are bullied, abused, or simply not right in the head. They find that a mass murder is exactly what they need to get their emotions on the media. We as a populace eat this shit up. Whenever a tragedy occurs we start saying \"omg, what a monster, he\'s not human, he\'s evil,\" and avoid the fact that he was human and that we are all just as capable. Maybe our Psychology isn\'t fucked up like his, but something made it fucked up in the first place. It\'s not the devil, it\'s not that he\'s an asshole, it\'s something to do both Neurologically and Socially that is causing this.\nThis is going on for awhile, so I\'ll cut it short here. I hope I\'ve made my point well.'),(227656,'This is so true, especially that last paragraph on psychology. The media fails to realise that when they shovel shit like \"he was an evil monster and anyone like him should be killed\", they immediately alienate anyone who has the potential to be in the same state of mind as him, and become more likely to do terrible things like Columbine/Aurora/Newtown or whatever.\nI\'m not saying we need to encourage these people to think the way they do, but a little less aggression and vitriol in our media would be more effective than a million gun control laws.'),(227657,'Ditto. Whatever you said. It is long so..., it must be good ;)'),(227658,'shit, i meant to put this as my source for self-defense and gun control.\nsorry.'),(227659,'We don\'t need gun control we need people control.

If i was a criminal i would get it illagly if i wanted it. And if i couldn\'t get that i would get a M1 Carbine or another rifle that is simiautomatic.

Gun regulation is necessary.\nThe fact that the weapons could be found, despite being banned, isn\'t the issue. We know that.

I am sorry to say it, but it is kind of her fault.

Growing up I remember regarding my country as the \"Home of the Brave and the land of the Free\", that isn\'t a term i\'m too familiar with any more. Having lived through the columbine shootings, the virginia tech massacre, most recently the sandy hill shootings and the utter chaos in Boston, I have seen public fear of firearms growing first hand. In the United States the number of mass shootings greatly outnumbers those in any other contry. \"15 of the 25 worst mass shootings in the last 50 years took place in the United States.\"Klein, 2. Why is that the case? That question has yet to be answered, but one thing is clear. Gun laws are clearly doing nothing to stop this.\ninevitably, we must look at some of the other countries policies to determine what they\'re dojng differently than we are here in the United States. Here are a few notable differences I have stumbled across.\nSwitzerland, a country of about 8 million people estimates there are about 2.3 million firearms within the countries borders. But firearms were only used in just 24 Swiss homicides in 2009, a rate of about 0.3 per 100,000 inhabitants. The US rate that year was about 11 times higher.\nTsutomu Uchida, Japanese shooting instructor\"In the US, people believe they have a right to own a gun. In Japan, we don\'t have that right. So our point of departure is completely different.\" Japanese citizens are not given gun rights.\nJapan requires a citizen to go to the police station and request to purchase a firearm, undergo a psych evaluation, and can even go as far as interviewing a citizens neighbors beforehand to ask if they have a temper.\nBecause off these extreme measures taken by the japanese government, more people were murdered with scissors(9 people) than with guns this past year in Japan.\nSo, what is the problem with the U.S? We seem to be right at the middle ground between Japan\'s very strict regulations, and switzerlands lenient policies, why is gun violence such a huge issue in America? Martin Killias, a Swiss Criminologist recently stated that \"The key issue is how many people have access to a weapon, not the total number of weapons owned in a country. Killias said. \"Switzerland\'s criminals, for example, aren\'t very well armed compared with street criminals in the United States.\"Killias 1. You see the majority of the firearms in Switzerland are issued to men when they join the country\'s conscript army,after training the soldiers generally keep the rifles and that\'s how most people obtain firearms there. It is very difficult to compare the U.S to switzerlands situation because our military is very different, this makes it hard to consider implementing a similar set of laws in the U.S. The two are just too different to compare.\nThe worst idea by far is to suggest the U.S follow the Brazillian model of Gun Control. Brazil recently banned all firearms, except for when used by the police and military. Brazil also sits at the top of the list when it comes to gun violence, they are the Gun Murder Capital. Large sophisticated gangs and drug trafficers are heavily armed, often better armed than the police and they control large cities throughout Brazil. The citizens hesitate to even arm themselves for self defense because the gang influence is so strong and terrifying. The last thing we need in the U.S, is stronger gang influence and better stocked gang armory\'s. So, what can we do to avoid this? Perhaps trying to modify the swiss model, and allow the right to bear arms but require more extensive screening and training before purchasing a firearm. Maybe adopt Japans strategy of requiring citizens to state their intent to the police before purchasing a gun? Whatever it may be, we cannot settle for losing our right to bear firearms simply because of fear generated towards them. We cannot sacrifice our rights to satisfy fear.\nsources:\nTalmadge, Eric. \"From Brazil to Japan: gun laws around the world\"Associated Press, January 28, 2013\nKlein, Ezra.\"Twelve facts about guns and mass shootings in the United States\" The Washington Post.

That can\'t be said for the religious debates on this site. Not as generally as it can be said for the gun debates, anyways.\nAnd there\'s also something to be said for the frequency. I should never see 3 debates about gun regulation out of the 5 debates listed in \"popular debates.\" That\'s just boring and trite and shows that the people who make these repetitious debates don\'t look into the subject on this site, first.'),(227887,'Okay, yes, I rather do see your point in that case.

Moreover, gun regulation is a superficial approach to an underlying problem. The state of mental health care is abysmal, and it seems logical to me that increasing social understanding of mental illness and health conditions as well as treatment and support for those experiencing mental ill-health would go a lot further in preventing gun violence.'),(227894,'I think so to. I found out that the person who shot up Virginia Tech was actually on drugs, but had stopped taking them. You know the commercials for anti-depressants say that a side-effect of stoppage in dose can lead to suicidal thoughts. They tested him and found no drugs in his system, even though there should have been. Being a little more careful and assertive on taking the drugs wold help. And almost every mass shooting in America since the 20th century was done by mental people.'),(227895,'I was not actually aware of the details about the Virginia Tech shooter, but it does not surprise me much. A lot of people living with mental illness or disorders end up with partial treatment because the system is so inadequate, and this is compounded by social ignorance surrounding mental health. I think more attention to the mental health crisis in the U.S. (and elsewhere) would reduce the amount of violence generally (not only gun violence). It would increase the likelihood of early intervention and diagnosis which makes treatment more effective.'),(227896,'Definitely.

The idea behind it, if I am not mistaken, is to dry up the supply. However, the sheer number of guns in circulation (legal and black market) within the U.S. and nearby countries would make such an approach rather impractical. Someone who wanted a gun could still get one, and I do not know that regulation would greatly impact the cost of acquisition. Perhaps I am too skeptical however; I really do not have the numbers to have a very strong opinion either way.\nGlad we are in agreement about mental health however. :)'),(227900,'I don\'t wish to imply that I believe these measure would solve the problem; only to help in the process.

The gun is what is directly taking the human life. To say that quote is false is just commonly statisticly untrue, as stated in my argument Against; \"For example, during a year when over 5,000 teens and children died from gun wounds in the USA, in Great Britain, where gun ownership is very restricted, 19 teens and children died from gun wounds.\"'),(228017,'I posted this on a similar debate and i believe it clearly shows my views:\nI agree that one should have the right to own arms but i do not believe on has to use violence to obtain their wildest gun dreams. if one wants to own a gun i have no qualms with them but if they wish to own guns such as a AK47 and AK74u they should be dealt with in a more civilized manner to protect the people.

Why?\nLets use a simple example, your walking home in the dark its quite and you think someones following you so have your hand on the gun and keep walking, looking back. Suddenly a car pulls in front of you, startled you naturally turn around and shoot. Theirs no one behind you, but an innocent dead driver in front of you.\nIts simple \"accidents\" like these account for most deaths. Having something less likely to kill a person, such as a taser, is much safer.

Guns kill children.\"\nFor example, during a year when over 5,000 teens and children died from gun wounds in the USA, in Great Britain, where gun ownership is very restricted, 19 teens and children died from gun wounds. This is very blunt statistic proof that states that gun control thats rectricted to certian personal keep citizens safe and reduces the death by guns.\nWith society and technology proggressing at such a fast speed, the need for barbaric uses of protections such as guns is not nessicary. Guns can be unpredictable and almost 84% of americans have not been trained in gun safety. With the uses of modern day technoloy for individual protection, gun control should only be restriced to select forces of the goverment who are trained in using these weapons.\nA huge part of american culture is film, and if you were to ask people if violence and special effects involiving guns and other firing weapons were nessicary to a good film, one out of two would say yes.

All we\'d have then is the same amount of violence except with blades. Wake up and look at the WORLD you are in not the fairy tale world you think your in. People like you are the people who get people killed.'),(228356,'Yes, I know that. I don\'t see that as any reason to add firearms to that increasing list of \'Methods of Killing People\'.\n\nDude. I know the world I am in. I was just stating that things would be better if the number of people who owned firearms would decrease significantly. Will this happen? Probably not, but it would be better for society.\n\nHow? How can me wishing we lived in a more peaceful world cause people to be killed? I would love to know, so do explain.'),(228357,'Wishing is doing nothing for the issue being discussed. Sure firearms kill but as I stated before people are the problem not the method in which things are killed. Yeah in. Perfect world we would all like one another, respect one another, and the need to kill would be non existent. However, we do not live in a perfect world. People are born everyday with weirdly wired portions of the brain that help develop them into an everyday, law abiding citizen or a rampaging lunatic that gets his jollys off by killing people. Again I see what your saying, that in the perfect world guns would not be needed and I agree. I mean no personal offense to you in particular but when I say it\'s \"People like you are the people who get people killed\", I mean that mindset. Some people have a tendency to believe in world peace and its a great notion but something that will never ever be attainable, period. Why? People. We all have our own ideas as individuals and our nations all have their own beliefs and ideas. Anytime we have a difference in opinion we all handle it differently. My point was simply that although you have a point, in a perfect world, that fighting ownership is ridiculous. Criminals will always have guns no matter what is passed, so why would it be a good thing that they take guns away from citizens.'),(228358,'This makes me want to pull my hair out because you think I\'m that kind of person, when I actually do believe that world peace will never happen. I wish it would, but I know that we are so far gone from that path that we can never achieve that.\n\nWell the question is why do criminals have guns? No one should have guns in the first place, but we do because violence is inevitable and that\'s our society for you.'),(228359,'hands kill people too should we take those away? like the next guy down was right there was violence long before guns. now i don\'t own a gun nor does any of my family but i still believe that guns don\'t lead to violence its just the unstable people who own them that create violence'),(228360,'Well, if people are unstable then why provide them with more ways to kill someone? I understand that banning guns won\'t stop people from killing anyone, but it will help with the situation.

It\'s filled with horrible people who do not care about human existence. I will never relinquish my firearms to anyone or anybody. It\'s my constitutional right and keeps me safe from evil men. Yes the world would be better without them completely but that\'s fantasy and will never happen. If you disarm citizens guess who will still have them? Oh yeah, criminals cause ya know its kinda their thing to break laws.

I think the problem of nut cases going on shooting rampages can best be solved by 1) If a person has been seeing a psychiatrist & taking prescription meds for say 1 or 2 yrs+ and the Pysch has any concerns about the mental stability of the patient, then they need to be put on a Gun Ban list. Can\'t by ANY guns.\n2) Cut out most of the violence in Video Games & movies. Especially some of the hard core video games. Younger people see so much violence.\n3) Better security at schools, Malls, & other places of large gatherings. Parents could have IDs w/ their picture & the picture of their kids on the same ID. If they have a lot of kids @ 1 school, they could have 2 ids. When they pick up their kid, they show their ID at a entry point. Who ever picks up the kids could have an id & if Grandma or Aunt Sue is picking up on occasion, Parent + designated person could notify the school ahead of time. Anyone w/out ID is stopped, questioned & sent to the main office for any further needed questioning.\nMalls & the like could have metal detectors at the entrance. If you set it off, you get searched (respectfully). Maybe it was just a big metal belt buckle, but checkout just to be safe.\nWhy I don\'t think banning guns or even assault rifles will help: 1) People who really want \'em will find a way to get them. 2) Bans only really affect law abiding citizens. Most of them aren\'t going to abuse it (assuming their sane - see above). Drugs are illegal...how many drug problems do we have in the US? People who really want them will get them anyway. Europe has gun bans and they still have problems.\n3) Banning guns, even assault rifles keeps arms out of the hands of responsible citizens. Criminals will be embolden knowing Joe Q Public can\'t buy a gun.\n4) Governments through out history have often abused their power & oppressed people when they think they can. A large populous with guns keeps Gov. a little on the cautious side.\nJust before Hitler took over he removed the guns from the citizens. He stated it was for everyone\'s safety and well being. Soon after he rounded up and exterminated people. Had the Jews and Polish had guns, the tragedy may not have happened.

But are these assertions true?\nIn that passage, Gandhi references India’s Arms Act of 1878, which gave Europeans in India the right to carry firearms but prevented Indians from doing so, unless they were granted a license by the British colonial government. The full text of what he wrote is: “Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the Act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest. If we want the Arms Act to be repealed, if we want to learn the use of arms, here is a golden opportunity. If the middle classes render voluntary help to Government in the hour of its trial, distrust will disappear, and the ban on possessing arms will be withdrawn.” These words come from a World War I recruitment pamphlet that Gandhi published in 1918, urging Indians to fight with their British colonial oppressors in the war, not against them. According to K.P. Nayar, chief diplomatic editor for The Telegraph in Calcutta, Gandhi saw “an opportunity for a political struggle against the colonial rulers and for the repeal of the unjust Arms Act,” not “for more Indians to have access to guns.” Peter Brock, a noted historian of nonviolence, wrote in his article “Gandhi’s Nonviolence and His War Service” that Gandhi “believed at that time (although he became more skeptical of this later on) that India could win equal partnership for itself within the British Empire if as large a number as possible of its able-bodied men volunteered to help the Empire, in one way or another, in times of need.” The British, that is, would regret passing the Arms Act because they’d discover Indians to be such valuable fellow soldiers.At this time, Gandhi was still a British loyalist. He hoped to encourage the British to repeal the Arms Act and grant India Home Rule within the British Empire. In his autobiography, Gandhi quotes a letter he wrote to the viceroy of India during the war, in which he declared, “I would make India offer all her able-bodied sons as a sacrifice to the Empire at its critical moment, and I know that India, by this very act, would become the most favoured partner in the Empire … I write this because I love the English nation, and I wish to evoke in every Indian the loyalty of Englishmen.”Gandhi wanted Indians to fight in World War I to prove themselves trustworthy with arms and fit for citizenship. He was advocating for appeasement of India’s colonial rulers, not independence from them. Later, Gandhi’s thinking on this subject would change dramatically, but when he did initiate a campaign for full independence from the British Empire, he advocated only nonviolent means of resistance.\nPro-gun activists frequently try to claim with that one, out-of-context sentence that Gandhi supported violence to defend oneself and others. This is a vast oversimplification of Gandhi’s views.\"\nThere was more to the article but I copied the part that put his words in context'),(228916,'I never insinuated that Ghandi supported violent ressistance. But he did realize that depriving people the use of arms is an evil thing to do as it endangers their lives.

Other countries with a similar socio-political make-up include the Scandinavian countries, Canada, England, and France - all of which show similar results with greater gun control laws.\nNow, you can argue the legitimacy of a handgun, hunting rifle, etc, and I would say it should be a local issue in each case (ie South Central Chicago might want different laws than rural Alabama).\nWhat you cannot do is say that having a oozi is self-protection. It is in the best case overkill, in the worst case a criminal who just has not been caught yet.'),(327055,'Ok, for the sake of discussion, lets throw out the survey. Why is it so hard to believe being armed and knowing how to use your weapons effectively will make you safer?\nThe reason you can\'t compare the United States and Australia on the subject of guns is because it won\'t produce clean results. In order to accurately compare or test a variable, the variable must be the only thing that changes. The United States and Australia have different laws and different governments, so it\'s impossible to derive a conclusive result about one variable. Furthermore, the socio-political makeup is different in the United States. Countries like Australia, Canada, England, and France all have a lot more socialism for instance.\nPart of my argument for this is common sense. If a criminal is lawless enough to use a weapon for malicious purposes, will he really care about the legality of his weapons? There\'s always a black market to turn to almost anywhere in the world. Also, guns aren\'t the only way violence can be carried out. If people really want to hurt other people, they\'ll find a way to do it.\nI agree with you that gun laws should be a local issue.\nIn some cases, an automatic weapon is more effective than a semi auto for self defense (such as when several intruders break into a home at once, or when someone breaks in with armor). I know these cases are very rare, but they do happen occasionally. And when they do, an oozi is in fact a sensible choice. That\'s why the military uses automatic M-16s.'),(327056,'A lot of things are common sense.\nThe numbers show that one who owns a gun is far more likely to accidently shoot himself, or have a child who figures out a way to shoot themself, then to ever encounter an intruder.

I live though 2 blocks from the LV strip, and I would \"feel\" safer knowing it was hard for my neighbors to get their hands on a gun, than I would with one of my own.\nVery few gun control advocates advocate total gun control, that is a strawman the NRA made up. Most gun control advocates simply want local municipalities to be allowed to look at the numbers and say \"okay, you can have a handgun but not an automatic\" in such and such a community, \"you can carry whatever you want in this community\" or if you\'re in the middle of the ghetto, maybe you can only own a hunting rifle.\nI see nothing wrong with this.'),(327057,'The numbers show that one who owns a gun is far more likely to accidentally shoot himself, or have a child who figures out a way to shoot themself, then to ever encounter an intruder. Home intrusions where the owner is home are less common than accidental shootings, that\'s a fact.\nI believe you will find, however, that the vast majority of accidental shootings are non-lethal. Intruders who break into an occupied home on the other hand, are likely to know the house is occupied, and come prepared with a weapon and have a conscious will to do damage.\n\nI\'m actually a member of the NRA, and I have yet to hear from them that the feds will completely ban all guns. What they will do however, is take smaller steps on a slippery slope. Things like bigger taxes on ammunition, a higher charge to obtain certain permits, bans on certain accessories, and even misleading legislation such as the \"assault rifle\" ban that would include many common hunting rifles.\n\nNeither do I. But the problem is that it is a slippery slope. The general trend in the past has been to legislate with continually more restrictive laws, and they seldom get repealed. This is what has gun enthusiasts upset. Trivial laws aren\'t so trivial when they continue to build up. And futhermore, who gets to decide what is reasonable?

We don\'t know a bad man till he has given us a reason to think/know he is bad.

And for your second point, most people who want guns for evil intentions don\'t buy them from a gun shop. They buy them \"under the table\" so to speak.

If your standpoint of argument is the fact that firearms increases the level of criminality of civilians, then that argument in itself is a constitutional violation of the civilian rights based on the constitution on which this country was built. Thirdly, guns are needed for protection in areas that have a high crime rate. A perfect example is a young father who i personally knew, and who was also a business man. He was robbed in front of his wife and children and then shot in the head and left to die. Take that for an example and imagine if he had access to a gun for his and his family protection, what would have happened.'),(327076,'Your entire argument is irrelevant.\nYour first point merely echoes my point about illegal/illicit drugs (why not legalize meth, crack, cocaine, and everything else because then the government can keep a registry of drug owners and monitor them but in the illegal way the government has no idea who owns drugs and this can cause a threat to society). See, you just substituted firearms for drugs.\nSecondly and most importantly, the debate is about automatic firearms. Tell me where I ever wanted to take away your \"God-given\" second amendment (By the way, just to point out, who cares if it\'s in the Constitution.

The whole purpose of legalizing firearms is the fact that it can be used for the purpose of self defence when a person\'s life is in danger. No one has the right to own these types of substances because by law, they are illegal. Gun is an equipment and not a substance. Meth and cocaine are substances. What are the benefits of owning drugs in terms of saving your lives? Can you use it to defend yourself?\nLet me ask you this question, if you dont care about the constitution because it is man made then how come you care about the illegality of crack or meth? Didnt man- made laws made those substances illegal? The ammendments were made to the constitution because as we approached a liberal era, the people gained more rights. The whole purpose of the ammendments are to protect the people from the power of the government when used in an unfair manner. You should be thankful that the constitutional gave minorites and the women the right to vote. The constitution never prohibited in the whole, that right was added on to it to widen the rights of the people.\nIf the father had access to a weapon, then his life would have been saved. What can be more dangerous than a father losing his life? How much dangerous can it get?'),(327078,'In reference to the Constitution, it is interesting how you fail to mention the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments which are directly amending the Constitution, not just adding things. Also, I would like to refer to you to George Carlin in reference to rights. If something is a \"right,\" how is it possible that rights change with time? Either it is a right, or it is not; it is not subject to the whims of the people, politicians, or populations. I believe in your right to self-defense.

Many people misinterpets the meaning of \'rights.\' It is not a right itself that changes overtime, it is we the people who give governments the power to take a right away from us because according to Howard Zinn, the government gets it power from the people and power and rights come from the people, not the government. Do you think the constitution was created by a government? Whether you believe in the right to firearm or not is what your opinion is but majority of the population would agree that law abiding citizens have a right to firearms which is why the constitution permitting the use of firearms was never challenged.\nIf you are saying that we should not give firearms to people because other people might get killed, then what you are implying is that we should take away the means from a person to protect themselves and let them die when we can provide them with the equipment that can save their lives. And by the way, majority of the crimes committed are committed by illegal gun posession and not legal gun posession.\nThe 13th, 14th, and 15th ammendments were rights bestowed upon the people in the constituion and not changes made to the constitution.'),(327080,'By whom?\n\nWhy is a negro no longer 3/5 a person, then?

Regardless, this section was directly changed by the 14th Amendment. I don\'t understand why you are arguing whether or not the Constitution has been changed.\nI\'m saying automatic weapons are entirely superfluous if one wishes to protect him or herself. A small arm, or non-automatic weapon would suffice just fine.'),(327083,'You said it yourself. 3/5 of the black population. Thus, there is a difference between a black person or any type of person being the value of 3/5 of a person and 3/5 of a population. But anyway back to the argument. I brought up the fact that the right to a firearm is within the constitution. You argued that the constitution is infallible or was changed. So you are the one that raised the effectiveness of the constitution, not me.\nIf a person chooses to have an automatic firearm or not, that is his decision, as long as he stays within the confine of the law because as a civilian, he has certain rights that the state cannot rid him of and the claim that owning a firearm is a potential for further criminality in a given population is a broad generalization in an argument without proper proof to prove so.\nFurthermore, if you are claiming that possession of gun leads to further criminality then i am surprised that your perception of small non automatic guns is different because gun in the whole can be a danger depending on how and where you use it. Your solution to a problem will have no effect on the problem at present if that is what you are proposing for a change.'),(327084,'I don\'t think you understand math.\n\nWhich one? It can\'t be both.

If you were smart enough you would figure that when i was referring to \"certain rights\" i was referring to the 2nd ammendment. You should probably check up the meaning of \"broad generalizations\" as well because it seems you have an issue in understanding the basics of english.'),(327086,'The Constitution was not taking a census, you do realize. They were saying that 3/5 of \"all other persons\" (i.e. slaves and other racial minorities) counted toward representation. Thus, the 14th Amendment changed this and made every person count toward representation. Effectively, it legitmized the position of former slaves as full citizens, whereas before they were clearly not.\n\nAnd what I\'m saying is these rights are not absolute. You do not get to own whatever you want whenever you want. You don\'t get to automatically own incredibly dangerous weapons. Or else why couldn\'t a citizen own a nuclear warhead, or why are there regulations on gun ownership like licensing?'),(327087,'Now that you have taken a proper approach towards your argument, i do agree with you that they were referring to as blacks and other minorities including the native indians as well as \"3/5 of all other persons\" because the presence of the British was still influencing America at that point and the rise of Civil Rights Movements caused the blacks to be free from slavery through rebellion against the Dictators. However, at that point, the constitution was never reviewed and was recently created by the wealthy upper class white members of society who thought that their actions were wise. Further review of the constitution lead to the institution of the 14th ammendment and due process clause. But as it is, the constitution has been reviewed for years and found to be appropiately fair not only by legislators but by several courts and human rights committee including the U.S Supreme Court.\nIf you recalled in my argument, i did not mention the term \"broad rights,\" instead i mentioned the term \"certain rights.\" This certain right was referring to the the use of applicable firearms for self defence and automatic firearms were ruled to be liable for self defence. So, certain rights would extend to the use of automatic firearms for the use of self defence by civilians. And you said it yourself, the people\'s actions are limited by the government through the process of licensing, thus, through this process, the government gets to monitor the use of firearms by the civilian population.'),(327088,'And thus the government may decide what is sufficient in order for civilians to defend themselves. I believe automatic weapons do not fall within that domain.'),(327089,'If you believe automatic weapons do not fall within that domain then point to a specific clause stating or proving your point. What you believe is your opinion, not the fact.'),(327090,'My argument is stated in previous entries.'),(327091,'Your argument is based on your opinion. I dont need to hear your opinions. I need to hear your proof. You said that the people\'s use of firearm is restricted, so if that truly is the case, then point to specific clause, stating so in any parts of the constitution or the bill of rights, since that is the ultimate source of rights.'),(327092,'And as we discussed, it is not really the Constitution that is the \"source of rights.\" Rights may not be decided on the whim of a document or a people, otherwise then they\'re not rights, they\'re privileges.\nTherefore, I only need prove that the \"rights\" given to us by the Constitution have ever been limited by actions from the government, to extend that as well to the 2nd Amendment. Take free speech, which has often times been limited by the government (e.g. you cannot yell \"fire\" when there is in fact no fire) when it is deemed that said right may be dangerous for other civilians. Similarly, the 2nd Amendment may be, and should be, limited in scope by restricting the general population from owning automatic firearms. Actually one is more likely to be involved in a homicide if one owns a gun, among a myriad of other statistics (see link). Additionally, countries with more restrictive gun control laws tend to have a higher homicide rate. Making guns more available, as well as increasing the firepower and killing power of a single weapon would dramatically increase one\'s susceptibility to violent crime via guns.'),(327093,'The constitution is mot merely privileges, it is a source of rights. Point out one phrase in the constitution that mentions the terms \"privileges.\" However you will find many of the terms listed as being \"rights.\" You claim that rights have not been decided merely on the basis of a document but bear in mind rights were decided by the U.S Supreme Court on the every document that we should refer as being the constitution of the United States.\nThe rights guaranteed in the constitution cannot be limited unless one trespasses the limits of these constitutional rights which are no longer protected by the government. Yelling fire in a crowd when there is no fire is not free speech as you claim because according to the law, it produces a bad result definitely, since it can cause panic and can even cause injury because people might try to escape in panic. In some instances, yelling fire in a crowd when there is no fire in a building can cause people to block up the exit leading to a depletion of oxyen which can result in people dying. Therefore, this is not a right as you claim. This is an act of crime that can result in severe danger or death to others. If i recall you stated in your argument that \"the 2nd Amendment MAY be, and SHOULD be.\" The words \"may\" and \"should\" illustrates that not even you yourself is certain in whether your perception of this issue is actually factual or just opinionated. Furthermore, weapons in the whole can increase a person\'s susceptibility to commit violent crimes but if that is true then:\nA) That includes and covers the possession and ownership of small guns as well so they should also be banned and\nB) How come the crime rate for LEGAL OWNERS of firearms has been significantly lower than that of the crime rate for ILLEGAL FIREARM OWNERS?'),(327094,'You misunderstand my problem with so-called \"rights.\" I am saying rights (fundamental, universal, human) are not granted via a document or Supreme Court ruling. These rights would include liberty, pursuit of happiness, and equality. These are vague constructs, yet seem to be morally appropriate to guarantee to all human beings, and thus are rights of all human beings. The constitution attempts to distinguish specific ways to achieve these various UNIVERSAL rights, and thus they are limited in their focus and intent. That is why I would rather not speak of the Bill of Rights or the Constitution as a way of measuring a right but rather a privilege.\n\nAnd thus you contradict yourself in one sentence. How can they not be limited, and yet still have limits, which trespassing those limits results in the creation of limits? My example of yelling fire in a crowd was a perfect example of even how freedom of speech (i.e. to say what you will when you will) is limited for the benefit of the majority. Thus we may place similar restrictions on other rights to benefit the majority.\nAdditionally \"may\" merely reflected the observation that the 2nd Amendment has been limited before, and \"should\" reflected my opinion that it should be. I\'m sorry, your analysis of simple language mechanics is faulty, and it appears you seem to be grasping at straws.\n\nNo, they should be restricted. Like any policy, there is a \"sweet spot\" of regulation and freedom. Too much regulation and people no longer have the \"right\" and too little and it is nearing anarchy. Currently, it appears to me that gun laws are much too lax, and should be strengthened.\n\nDo you see how I provided actual, factual statistics? Do you see how you have not?'),(327095,'First of all, prove to me that righ5ts are not granted via document or court ruling. The U.S Supreme Court has not granted any civilians rights but they have interpreted the rights available in the constitution and prohibit the government from violating these rights. If the Supreme Court and any document which you are claiming was not the source of rights, then why were various case laws made from these sources and why was the government prohibited from passing laws that would violate the constitutional rights of civilians. If i recall, the Supreme Court has dealt with various cases regarding racial bias, due process, 4 th amendment searches and seizures as well as racial stereotyping. The Court ruled in all these cases that due process and equality has been denied in these cases and therefore these people were freed because the source of their rights, the constitutional rights were violated. A privilege is something that you can take away whereas rights are something you cannot take from a citizen.\nAgain, you seem to be having a hard time in understanding the technicality of my perception. How can you call the commission of a crime as a right? If one does something that produces a bad result and can endanger other lives, how can you refer to that as being a right or privilege? What you are referring to is not freedom of speech. That is referred to as a crime. There is a difference between something that we enjoy as a right but does not protect us from committing crimes. For example, the freedom of speech also extends to actions, meaning that we have a right to display our actions, so lets assume that i have a right to free speech, does that mean i can go and burn down buildings or killing people to get my message across because i have a right to free speech? Again, your example is a crime and not a right. You should read up on what adds up to a right and a crime respectively.\nIf i was in a debate in court and used the term \"MAY\" people would assume i myself am not sure of the point i am trying to get across. That proves that you are not certain if what you are saying is the truth or you think it might be true or not true what you are saying. My analysis of simple language is based on the language you put forth so don\'t blame me for observing for what is put forth in front of me. Let me give you an example, if cops arrive on a scene to arrest a person and the person is suspected of being in a building so the cops approach you and ask you if he is in the building or not and you respond by saying \"MAYBE\" then that means that you are not sure but you think he might be. You see the difference between certainty and uncertainty and how words illustrate our inner opinions or may contradict our points?\nI think you are failing to realize or accept that restrictions will have no effect on guns. These people need to be monitored. What evidence have you provided? Factual evidence from the FBI? Which is responsible for collecting and storing records of crime?'),(327096,'Our perceptions of rights differ in my definition is an absolute, i.e. rights exist regardless of documents, and yours are relative, i.e. a document provides them and thus are limited by those who are governed by those documents. Does that clear up the matter?\nI said, \"You may pass me the cheese now,\" quite obviously I am not having uncertainty over whether or not I will receive cheese, I am merely being polite and saying you are physically allowed to pass me the cheese. I believe I was referring to restricting the second amendment in this way, i.e. we are allowed to limit/regulate that right.\n\nAnd thus, you completely ignored my simple request. I did provide several studies (though embedded in an article). And for someone who has such little faith in government (after all, we need all the guns we can get to protect ourselves from their tyranny), you would still trust their studies?\n(http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/weapons.cfm)\n(http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/glance/tables/firearmnonfataltab.cfm)\nAre those enough trends?'),(327097,'I think you are misunderstanding the perception of what importance that document serves. You are forgetting that since we do not get our rights from the government, there needs to be a document which is the ultimate source of rights that serves the purpose of preventing the government from infringing upon our rights since government tends to act in conflict to the interests of its people. Let me remind you that when this constitution was created back then, it first had to be approved by the people before it could become effective and to this day, it still is accepted and approved by the majority of the population. You are failing to understand that there is a difference between what you referred to as being a crime and what is actually a right. How can we have a right to commit a crime when the example you gave is clearly a crime? Governments are not limiting our rights because the right you are referring to is not a right but rather a crime, therefore that cannot be found in the source of rights because it is a violation of the laws.\nIf you said to me that you MAY pass me the cheese, you used the term MAY because you are not certain if i will. If you used the term PLEASE, then you are displaying a sign of politeness.\nFinally, i did take a look at those statistics you sent to me and there is one major problem that i observed. Why is it that your graph fails to point out what proportion of these crimes were committed by legal or illegal firearm holders? As far as i am concerned, all these crimes could have been committed by illegal firearm holders because the graph itself fails to refer if these gun crimes were committed by illegal and or legal firearm holders, thus the proof you sent me still do not justify the point you are trying to make. I am surprised that you questioned my faith in a government by trusting their statistics when your argument illustrates a low level of faith in the government, but yet at the same time, you are using government statistics. And like i mentioned, your studies make no distinctions of gun crimes committed by illegal and legal firearm holders so how are we supposed to figure out which category makes up the larger portion of those crimes committed?'),(327098,'I\'m saying that the whims of the majority do not guarantee, grant, or deny anyone rights. Thus, neither does the document. Rights are an intrinsic aspect of an existence. You may not say, \"Oh, I don\'t like him, so I\'m going to write a document and get it approved by the governing force to take away his rights.\" Do you recognize how ridiculous that is?\n\nPlease, give this up. This is a very small straw you\'re grasping at. Focus on substantive parts of my argument.\nHow about a quote:\n\"In the 1992-93 Kansas City experiment, a number of police officers in the inner city of Kansas City were put specifically and entirely on the duty of searching for and eliminating illegal firearms. This heightened crackdown took place over a period of 29 weeks, after which results were studied and compared with those of the first, unchanged 29 weeks. After the 29 weeks of heightened activity against illegal firearms, the rates of gun crimes in the part of the city monitored decreased significantly, by almost 50%, whereas the \"control\" section of the city, in which a crackdown on illegal guns was not enforced, experienced no change in its crime rate.\"\nQuite obviously, if police crack down on illegal firearms, and gun crime rate decreases by almost 50%, you see that most gun crime is committed by illegal firearms. That is why it stands to reason that by making more powerful guns more readily available, crime rate would probably be increased because criminals would have much greater access to much more powerful weapons. Please, read the site i provided earlier: http://www.guninformation.org/\nAlso, it appears that yet again, I am the only one providing a factual, statistical backup for my responses.'),(327099,'It amazes me that you seem to be having a hard time to grasp the point i am trying to make. If the rights come from the people, then it takes majority of the people to put that right into effect. Rights do not just come from anywhere, they come from the people. One senior prosecutor examined your argument last night and told me to ask you, if you do not need a document to prove that you have rights, then how come you need a document to prove in a court of law that you are innocent when you are already innocent and also said that you should point to any specific part of the constitution that states the term \"privileges.\" Why would the people write a document to take away somebody else rights when the same rights that they have created for themselves would apply to all citizens of that country. Do you know how ridiculous that argument sounds?\nIf there was a crack down on illegal firearms, then that points out to the fact that if government monitors the using of firearms by civilians then the level of firearm crimes will decrease. This is a form of monitoring in which certain requirements are not met, so the government seizes hold of that firearm until the requirements are met. If most gun crimes are committed by illegal firearm holders then it means that legal ownership of firearms combined with government monitoring can have a positive effect.\nThe site that you provided me with seems to be lacking impartiality since it seems to be biased. At the beginning of the site, the author did not post his name (i wonder why nor the date the information was last updated or published) and because of his bias and lack of impartiality, any information obtained would be biased since he is obtaining information to satisfy his level of bias. In all of his argument or evidence, he introduced sources who were biased to gun rights which leads me to wonder why did he not introduce sources favorable to gun rights and then produce counter sources to counter act the point made by those sources?\nSecondly, some of the sources were from religious sources which is an issue since sources that are religious in nature would tend to mix religion with logic.\nThirdly, some of the results in the research were conducted in different countries, which is unacceptable for me to read since you cannot in any way compare a country to the United States because there can be more than one factor that can be causing the gun crime rate there and also there is a difference in the size of the country and the population as well as social issues.\n\"Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz have found that as many as 400,000 people per year use guns in situations in which they later claimed that the gun almost saved their lives. Even if these estimates are off by a factor of 10, it means that armed citizens may save 40, 000 lives yearly\" (Siegel, Larry J. (2008), Introduction to Criminal Justice (12th Ed.), pg. 70)\nAlso the source of the problem is illegal firearm ownership because according to the National Crime Victimization Center, illegal firearms are used in about 20 percent of robberies, 10 percent of assaults and 5 percent of rapes. Therefore, if you outlaw automatic guns criminals will still have access to these guns because there are still gangs who have access to these guns and can sell them to earn a profit.\n\"Banning the use of firearms will lead to that gun having more value which can lead to an increased trafficking in gun as well as other illegal substances (Siegel, Criminology: Theories, patterns and typologies 10th Ed. pg. 50)'),(327100,'So what you\'re saying is rights are decided by a majority? You have the freedom of speech because a bunch of people voted that people should be allowed to speak there mind? Does that not also imply that rights may be taken away in a similar manner? Therefore, that \"right\" is not so much a right in that it is yours no matter what as much as it is a privilege granted to you by a population. I am saying rights are absolutes, transient of any human document. You\'re saying rights are fabrications of a human society and thus vary not just from place to place but person to person as well. I do not understand how a document is proof. A document proves something has happened before. It does not physically allow or disallow you to do things. A document really has no power beyond the power people place in it.\n\nIt doesn\'t. I\'m just disputing your concept of what is a right.\n\nThat was the entire point.\n\nYour entire argument was based on the efficiency of government monitoring and thus being able to crackdown on illegal firearms (I think. Your argument was confusingly worded, e.g. \"certain requirements\"). Why did you suddenly lump \"legal ownership of firearms\" into the argument when you had previously not substantiated that claim?\n\"\'Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz have found that as many as 400,000 people per year use guns in situations in which they later claimed that the gun almost saved their lives.

(2008), Introduction to Criminal Justice (12th Ed.), pg. 70)\"\nThis argument is actually addressed by a Harvard professor of Health Policy, David Hemenway. He states:\n\"Since a small percentage of people may report virtually anything on a telephone survey, there are serious risks of overestimation in using such surveys to measure rare events. The problem becomes particularly severe when the issue has even a remote possibility of positive social desirability response bias. Consider the responses to a national random-digit-dial telephone survey of over 1500 adults conducted in May 1994 by ABC News and the Washington Post. [34] One question asked: \'Have you yourself ever seen anything that you believe was a spacecraft from another planet?\' [Page 1438] Ten percent of respondents answered in the affirmative. These 150 individuals were then asked, \'Have you personally ever been in contact with aliens from another planet or not?\' and 6% answered \'Yes.\'By extrapolating to the national population, we might conclude that almost 20 million Americans have seen spacecraft from another planet, and over a million have been in personal contact with aliens from other planets. That more than a million Americans had contact with aliens would be incredible news--but not the kind actively publicized by reputable scientists.\"\n\nYes of course, and you aren\'t either?\n\nAnd what exactly is your basis to say that religious people would falsify data or conduct irresponsible surveys? You imply that religious people are illogical (or that the two are mutually exclusive) but I have met very many religious people who are exceptionally logical. Actually, it would be ILLOGICAL to come to the conclusion that there is absolutely no way religion is right about (a) god(s), as it is simply impossible for either side to prove existence or nonexistence. Therefore, to assume that religious people are illogical would be itself a logical fallacy.\n\nYes of course, you may not compare other countries to the US when talking about guns, except of course when it\'s the countries with low crime rates and low gun control.\n\nAnd making guns more available will actually have the opposite effect, right? Making automatic weapons cheap and readily available will completely disincentivize ownership of automatic weapons.'),(327101,'Rights have always been decided by the majority because it takes the cooperation of the majority to put it into effect. But anyway since we both agree that rights exist but we disagree on the sources of rights i will address that. Th constitution is a document that was written and preserved and handed down from one generation to the next. It is a living proof that we are protected by rights which guarantees protection from the government. Before that constitution, was created, majority of the people voted for it to be put into effect. If you don\'t believe that rights come from the majority then how come laws are created with the approval of majority of the population? How come before we can over throw a government, majority of the votes from the population needs to outweigh the minor? How come when a Supreme or Appellate Courts decides a case, it takes majority of the votes to make a decision in that case? The human society was and is constructed in such a way that the larger population decides what is a right and hardly have they taken away a right from somebody else. Didn\'t majority of the population voted for certain actions to be labelled criminal, so would you say that is unfair because majority of the population took away the right from another civilian to commit a crime? That is the very reason why a document has power, because it is made up of the power THE PEOPLE gave it that power which serves as a proof against governmental infringement of our rights. Furthermore, at that time the constitution was created, there was no opposition to it from the people.\nI am surprise you were arguing earlier that the constitution is privileged but yet in the same document you are disputing you cannot point to one specific word pointing to privilege meanwhile at the same time you will find many amendment such as the 4th amendment beginning with \"the right of the people.\"\nIt is interesting that you do not see \"certain rights\" as related to the 2 amendment as i am explaining and repeating myself for the 3rd time which goes back that firearms CANNOT be restricted to people especially since it is designed in a way that is useful for self defense (Automatic firearm). If you don\'t understand government monitoring to be legal ownership then i advise you to put your critical thinking skills to work before responding to an argument.\nYour argument and the evidence you introduced is weak. The source i introduced is a source that is valid and is being used by all schools offering law and pre-law countrywide. Moreover, the author of that textbook is the chairperson of John Jay School of Criminal Justice as well as a professor at many other law schools. He is also a criminologist and one of the most recognized authors. Secondly, how do you know that these surveys were completed via telephone? How do you know that these researchers were not representing a government funded research? I see no point in a rebuttal that has nothing to do with the source i have introduced.\nHe said that he would like to introduce information pertaining to gun control and introduced sources which were from religious sources and other sources that all demonstrated campaigns against firearm rights in general. Why did you not answer the part where i asked you why he did not introduced statistics from the supporter researches of gun rights and why does he fail to mention his name? We are in a debate but he is introducing factual information, thus there is a difference between my method of debating and his method of presenting information.\nSources that are religious tend to produce bias information because their emotions prevents them from accepting logical information in terms of issues pertaining to social structure. I did not in any way mentioned they are illogical or logical. My point i am trying to establish is that they have a religious view on certain logical issues that causes them to produce information to satisfy their logic. Take abortion and prostitution as examples. Also if you recall my point i said MIX RELIGION WITH LOGIC. What part of that statement points to what you are illustrating?\nLow crime rates can be the result of better social structure and not just low gun rate. It could be the result of a smaller population and better availability of education and jobs. These are all issues pertaining to crime so hence, your argument is merely opinionated rather than factual.\nThe point that you are failing to understand that illegal firearms will contribute to more people owning guns illegally without the government having any knowledge thereof and can cause a increase in crime. Therefore the best form of system is a system of monitoring firearms users, not restrict them.'),(327102,'I can essentially ignore the rest of your argument and point out one specific point:\n\nFirstly, of course my argument is opinionated. That is what an argument is. It is based on facts (and you calling them \"weak\" simply because the other did not provide you facts that you would like to have used does not negate that he does in fact present facts).\nSecondly, yes, your argument about those issues all pertaining to crime is entirely valid. So why then can you say that if we were to have automatic weapons, we would be safer? Countries with legal automatic weapons would have different demographics. Various states have various demographics where perhaps an automatic weapon would be beneficial, as do counties, cities and neighborhoods. You must recognize that we must be able to compare a very broad swath of humanity (the US is a big place) and say that for the majority of places in the US, automatic weapons would not provide enough of a benefit to outweigh their risks.\nEh, I can\'t resist the rest of your argument. Well, most of it. I feel we should limit our discussion to the discussion of automatic weapons and thus eliminate our discussion of where rights originate as it has grown quite off topic. I\'ll make a separate debate for it if you wish.\n\nI don\'t not understand your argument, it is just the phrasing and syntax is quite amorphous.\n\nAnd my refutation of that source was a man named David Hemenway, a professor of Health Policy at the Harvard school of Public Health, director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, among other titles related to the field of public health. I would posit he is a reliable source.\n\nThis is how I know, \"We use the most anonymous possible national survey format, the anonymous random digit dialed telephone survey.\" (http://www.guncite.com/gcdgklec.html)\n\nBecause Kleck makes it quite clear that he does not accept the data compiled by the Bureau of the Census to be valid.\n\nAnd thus they are illogical. I\'m sorry, but that is what you are saying, and I find it incredibly narrow-minded to dismiss a survey (not an interpretation of a survey, but the survey itself) based on the fact that it was conducted by a religious organization.\n\nThat would be okay, but to introduce information that supports gun control? Off with his head! The point is, yes, if you bothered to read any of the rest of the site, you would notice that quite obviously the author is a gun control advocate. However, that does not dismiss the information he presented. Information is information.\n\nYour first sentence is perhaps the most circular argument I\'ve heard: illegal firearms will cause more people to own guns illegal because they will be illegal if people own them.\nObviously.\nHowever, you fail to understand that if you make automatic weapons legal (and all weapons apparently. You say earlier in your argument suddenly that you are advocating a complete lack of restrictions on firearms, \"firearms CANNOT be restricted to people,\" although I believe we had previously discussed how it was necessary to restrict gun activities from various groups of people-like insane people or criminals-or to make it necessary for government regulation of the gun market. This seems like a frightening prospect, much more so than a restriction of automatic weapons.), the pool of automatic weapons will in fact enlarge, and more people will own them, and the weapons will be more accessible by those who may have been hesitant about ownership simply because of their illegal nature. Suddenly, it would seem more acceptable to rob a convenience store with an automatic weapon versus a handgun or a knife. Saying that having a small pool of automatic weapons leads to a greater number of people having automatic weapons is quite illogical.'),(327103,'unfortunately, automatic weapons were not designed for self defense, and I am not entirely sure where you pulled this misinformation from.

Do you need an AK for protecting yourself from muggers?\n\nWhere have I said anything about banning guns.

If you want to take this back to the founders, they would be appalled at the way people abuse the Second Amendment in order to justify owning frivolous (for civilians) arms. The worst they had were muskets (inaccurate at that) and canons (more so) that came no where near the deadly force of even a handgun today.'),(327108,'Hunting with automatic weapons is illegal in the United States and unsportsmanlike besides. Although if a bear is charging at you, it would be good to have an automatic .45 to kill it before it kills you. And automatic weapons are much more effective than semi-autos to eliminate multiple or armored targets (such as gang break-ins, or an intruder with a bullet proof vest).\n\nThey most certainly would not. Every one of them thoroughly understood the importance of having an armed citizenry, and they encouraged the ownership of guns as much as they could. Without the strong prevalence of firearms in early America, they could have never succeeded in their revolution, and without the continuation of armed citizens, the government could obtain absolute power and oppress the people.\n\nBut the important part was the fact that weapons were evenly matched. People could still kill each other with firearms, and often did in the revolution. Thousands upon thousands of people met their fate at the end of a gun making the gun violence of today a drop in the bucket (despite the fact that they are more advanced). Everyone was well aware of their lethal potential, and yet they were encouraged anyways because when a society is armed, citizens are much more reluctant to commit a crime and governments are much more reluctant to oppress the people.'),(327109,'Yes, shooting an automatic weapon in a domestic area sounds like a fine idea.

Therefore, to claim that you need an automatic weapon to defend you and your family against these hordes of automatic-weapon-bearing criminals is simply ludicrous.\n\nNo, but the billions (to trillions worldwide) of money spent on arming ourself with firearms could largely be used more efficiently spent on better educating a nation.'),(327112,'When someone (or multiple people) break into your house, seconds count.

And I apologize if I upset you with my answer to your question regarding the family but what I meant was that the situation could have been escalated to a far more dangerous situation should the father have pulled a gun on the robber. The father would like any other normal person have been slightly hesitant about shooting someone.'),(327117,'It most certainly would not be for the better, and I believe you underestimate American attachment to their gun rights. There are several million gun owners here, and if the right to bear arms was revoked, there would almost certainly be a civil war.

Banning the use of firearms on civilians would most certainly introduce a new civil war in society and more damage to the society than one could imagine. Because if a right is taken awasy from them, then they will see it as a form of dictatorship and hence try to rebel since it is a right granted to them by the constitution. Not only would it create a civil war but the crime rate will also go up because the illegal firearm owners will now have the upper hand on choosing and attacking their potential victims.'),(327119,'By revoking peoples right to bare arms I didn\'t mean that the government is to swoop down and forcefully collect everybody\'s guns, I was thinking of something a bit more gradual like perhaps starting with putting up restrictions to make it more difficult to buy a gun.\nAnd on the second point I sincerely hope that all Americans aren\'t so hardened and cold that they could without even a second of hesitation pull out a gun and immediately shoot someone. To believe that any regular person no matter the country could easily gun down an other person is delusional. I\'m not trying to be offensive and I understand that there are people that would have an easier time shooting someone than others but the reality is that most people would hesitate even for only the briefest moment and that moment can be vital to what happens next.'),(327120,'Then the conflict would only be delayed.

Even if that means killing the attacker.'),(327121,'First of all, most of the laws are updated because of the constitution. In most of the instances, government might create or already have a law that is infringing upon the rights of the people so when a person is incacerated because of the vagueness, ex post facto or inefficient law, the Supreme Court has to interpret the Constitution and then apply it to update the law. There are so many case laws that were created from the constitution and so many laws created by legislators were striked down because it was seen as a violation of civilian rights when interpreted by the constitution.\nDo you think, that if we are in a emergency, we can always depend on police officers to save us? Do you think that if i call 911, and there is a man holding a gun, and the cops take appromixately 15 mins to arrive, between the scope of that 15 minuites, i will be begging for my life and defenseless infront of my perpretator only for the cop to arrive and then find my dead body. As it is, many laws are already favorable to the defendant and what you are proposing is a law favorable to the defendant because the victim is not allowed to carry a weapon but at the same time, the defendant will still carry a weapon even if it is illegal for the sole purpose of robbing someone or killing someone.\nI agree with you that maybe the situation could have escalated but how do you know that it could have? Are you certain or just making a presumption? How come in many other cases, people that uses gun for self defence dont end up injuring other members of their families in the process of defending themselves. Take for example the Connecticut murders that took place recently, in which the father was tied up, beaten, wife and two daughters killed in which one of the daughter was raped infront of the family before she was killed.

How can we know if this country will benefit from that policy until you give them a chance to put it into effect.

This should be a clear indicator that legal ownership of guns in no way has increased potential criminality for law abiding citizens.

There is too much gun violence in America.'),(357208,'No, it is the exact the opposite, the right to life means private protection of one\'s own life, and the one way is open carry of weapon.\nMore gun control will only put more guns in criminals and take out weapons of law abiding citizens.'),(357209,'So all the children who were injured/murdered in the Theatre were supposed to have guns of their own, or else they wouldn\'t have died?'),(357210,'The right to life means the right to live, not the right to kill.\nThe right to not get shot at trumps the right to shoot people.'),(357211,'If someone is threatening another person\'s life, he has every right to kill in the name of protection. This is standard police protocol, therefore, it should be every private individuals as well.'),(357212,'Standard police protocol in America anyway. In Britain we prefer less barbaric methods of crime control. And doesn\'t what you\'ve just said contradict your libertarian philosophy in terms of being anti death penalty? Because giving people the right to shoot criminals is allowing the death penalty for crimes.\nYou can defend yourself without killing people. Use a taser if you\'re really that paranoid.'),(357213,'Apparently, the Britians are so much more civilized than Americans.\nActually, Libertarians dont agree universally on everything. Using force against force is not the death penalty considering it is defending one\'s own life. As a human being, it is an right to defend my life if threanted by danger. Death penalty is a legal term.\nUsing a handgun doesnt always translate into death just as using a tazer doesnt always mean nondeadly.'),(357214,'The exact opposite would be forcing people to carry guns. Which would be as much, or more I\'d argue, a violation of other\'s rights than limiting the type of weapon one can carry. So not \"opposite.\"\n\nOkay. But you\'re arguing guns in general, not controlling the type of guns. You\'re inflating the opposite position to fit your argument against it better. You can protect yourself (well, psychologically feel like your protecting yourself) with a handgun... with a tazer actually as someone below points out.\n\nWhy would they then get more guns? Seems they\'d have the same at most. Less more likely since they\'d be more difficult to get at the least.\n\nNo, it would take assault and semi-automatic weapons out of the hands of both law abiding citizens and psychotics.\nSure, drug dealers and whatnot might have as many, or a few less of these guns I\'d guess, they\'d still have them though, sure. You aren\'t going to protect yourself from this element of crime though. That is what police are for.\nWho won\'t have these types of guns though are psychos like this guy and people who commit spur of the moment crimes.'),(357215,'Restrictions on gun ownership would push more guns into the Black Market.\nThe same happened with Prostitution. Prostitution was safe and available to all legal citizens before it was made illegal. Most prostitutes were managed by Madams. Once prostitution was pushed into the Black Market, madams practically disappeared and Pimps took over.\nGuns in the legal market are to the discretion of the County, State, and Merchant. Gun control (yet not gun BANS) is Constitutional at the State level, so long as legal citizens are not barred from being able to carry guns. This keeps the gun flow regulated without any real regulation, because even States with little to no gun control keep firearms at the discretion of merchants, whom often times choose their customers.\nbut the tighter the restrictions on purchasing weapons, the more guns get pushed into the Black Market. Either by stealing or by importing illegally. This keeps guns out of the hands of legal citizens and into the hands of criminals.\nThe only way to limit guns for criminals (yet eliminating them will be impossible) is to have a Nation wide ban on guns and much tighter control on our borders since many illegal firearms come from south of the border. This calls for much greater border patrol. As well, you create a much higher demand for criminal organizations to either steal weaponry or work more with the Cartel to bring in more guns. Criminals don\'t just say \"no guns? oh well.\" If their operation requires guns, they will get them.\nAs for killers like John Holmes, while a Nation wide ban on guns may prevent him from shooting up the theater, it won\'t stop him from killing the people he wants to kill. John Holmes wired his apartment with explosives, and it\'s not unlikely that he would have used explosives in the theater if he couldn\'t use guns. That would have, ironically, probably killed more. In fact, the worst school massacre in US history was by explosives.\nMass Murderers are truly the only sort of good argument against guns, yet most have not even used assault rifles. John Holmes used an AR-15, a semi-automatic rifle, as assface pointed out, that is no different from a hunting rifle. I\'ve fired guns at a firing range and one of them included an AR-15. it is deadly, but not the Rambo type shit you\'re thinking of.\nThe ideal way to look at gun control is that it\'s possible to stop things like this. But the reality is that really... it isn\'t.'),(357216,'The exact opposite of gun control is not forcing people to carry guns, it would actually imply the freedom to purchase and carry a weapon at one\'s choice. Gun control implies restricting the sale and carry of weapons. The government has no authority to force people to carry guns.\n\nNo type of gun should be controlled. If someone wants an automatic weapon, they will get it via the black market at the right price.\n\nAre you really that stupid? It is called the black market.\nThis is like saying how did people get alcohol during prohibition. \"It seems they\'d have the same at most, maybe less more likely since they\'d be more difficult to get at the least.\"\nYou are an idiot.\n\nPsychos will get weapons no matter what either at WalMart or black market.\n\nI am not worried about the mafia or drug dealers because I don\'t get myself involved with them and they are not worried about me. It appears that the police doesn\'t either. The government is constantly brided by the mafia and drug dealers to stay off the territory or they will have a city war.'),(357217,'The person who committed the shooting bought all his guns and ammunition legally.'),(357218,'you dont think law abiding citizens can go violent ithink anyone having a really bad day could lose it....'),(357219,'i think law abiding citizens can go violent to and giving anyone a gun is stupid'),(357220,'I say we ban alcohol and Tobacco first then the humans.haha Funny how Marijuana is not on the list.

(Horrifying imagery would you not say) If someone is determined to harm that the medium in which they employ becomes secondary to the mechanics of it. Restricting gun control will not prevent such things as this from happening. The difference between owning a gun for home defense and going on a rampage is the owner.

The hasty conclusion here is the position that gun control should be increased.\nFurther, the idea of increasing gun control hinges on the concept that such a restriction of freedom is justified in the first place--which I maintain it is not. The mere act of owning a gun is not an immediate and active harm to someone else. According to, for example, the Non-Aggression Principle, such ownership is always allowed or justified, because it is not done in direct coercion, extortion, or deception, of another.

There is nothing compelling about any of the revolutions mentioned which anyone could reason were an excuse to allow whoever whatever gun they want.\nWere the militias armed by the State (our country, lol) of Texas? Or were the guns the brought mainly the guns they owned before the fighting? Did James Bowie bring a box of a hundred muskets and pass them out before the last stand at the Alamo, or did individual soldiers mainly supply their own weapons and equipment beforehand?'),(360790,'It was as combination of both. A lot of people did have guns, but hundreds and hundreds were provided by the state in addition to this, and everyone who had a gun was first trained. The point is A: they weren\'t a bunch of paranoid hillbillies with trust issues, they were regular people with a firearm maybe used for hunting because they didn\'t have a grocery store on every corner, and in rare rare instances self-protection because they didn\'t have police departments in every town. B: They were a regulated militia trained in lieu of a standing militia which at the time was practically non-existent.\nAnti-gun-regulation (what they really are, not pro gun, no one is \"taking guns away\") proponents make dozens of completely false correlations concerning this time period, along with the many many strawmen they feel a pressing need to argue against no matter the actual debate.\nOne of the false correlations is the old-time pioneer or the U.S. revolutionary to themselves. They are neither. Pioneers did not have guns for the joy of gun collecting and because they were scared of shadows, they had them to hunt and because they lived in areas that were for all purposes often lawless.\nWell you\'re allowed to hunt all you want in the U.S. so long as it\'s not to the extinction of a species, it\'s even encouraged where certain species begin to overpopulate. And you can use firepower that is 100x better than what any pioneer had.\nSo they have that right plus some.\nYou are also allowed guns for self-protection, several in fact. You are allowed firepower that is 100x better than what any pioneer had to protect themselves.\nSo they still have that right plus some.\nEven though there is 0 threat, 0 none zilch, a complete absence of threat from either a foreign power or a domestic power comparable to anything during the time they dream they are still in, even though we have in place armies and police that they are perfectly free to fucking join if they want to handle all of that for them, we still say \"okay paranoid weirdo, you can have X amount of firepower to satisfy your fantasy\"\nSo they still have that right plus some.\nStill, they insist that some right which was granted at the founding of the country is being denied them.\nIt is the steady and predictable scenario of confusing the addition of rights within a society which would have been unimaginable at that time, decried as some horrid and unjust trampling of freedoms.\nIt is fucking silly.'),(360791,'Yes, but in the case of fighting back against the government of one such as the United States of America, you cannot state that there is evidence of such a revolution being successful. The government of the United States is far more powerful than any of the those other governments during that time. Yes, Libya and Syria were different, if you\'re referring to the modern day struggles, but they are still war-torn, and it doesn\'t seem to be getting better. If we are to even stand a chance against our government, we need more than just guns. You can\'t successful fight against tanks, militaristic planes, missiles, and various other weapons with just assault rifles. So if you\'re suggesting that all the public needs is assault rifles to combat against a tyrannical United States government, then you might want to recheck what the government\'s capabilities are.\nTo be honest, though, I am fine with people having guns, but I see no reason for assault rifle possession among civilians. Why do people need something that can release such a large amount of bullets when the gun is already extremely lethal with just one in the barrel? I have not seen a valid reason as to why any civilian needs one. If you could please explain that to me, I would be very grateful.'),(360792,'Why do we need a car? You can mow down so many people with it. More people are killed in car accidents in a year than guns. Knives kill more people than guns each year. Why don\'t we ban those? If we ever had to go to war (and I hope we never do) I want to have the same weapon the enemy has. So it\'s harder to get the upper hand. The second amendment was designed to keep a people free and a government good. Now some argue that they never imagined assault rifles (which are already banned anyway). They didn\'t, but kinda did at the same time. The idea was that the people have the same kind of arms the government has. Both sides had muskets and cannons. We have modern weaponry. Disarming a population makes it very easy for the government to get the upper hand. Now that was about governments. Which according to many would crush a revolt. So lets talk about defense against another. Many people have defended themselves and others with these kind of weapons. I believe there was a man who defended his home against a mob in LA with an AR-15. This was a couple of decades ago. It is a deterrent against foreign invasion. It is a deterrent against criminals. It is a deterrent against those who want to oppress. Did you know the US Communist party actually sent a letter to Obama saying banning guns is the right thing to do to advance their agenda? Communists are pretty radical guys. History can attest to that. Any gun is lethal. Even a little .22 calibre. The problem is not the tool, but who uses it. It\'s like banning airplanes after 9/11. Nobody thought of that. They wanted to catch the men who did it. A man walks in with a weapon and kills 20 children. They want to ban the gun he used. They don\'t even consider the people or factors that caused this sick man to do what he did. It had to be brought up before they said, \"Oh, yeah. The mental health should be looked at too. Or poverty.\" I think targeting the nerve centers of these is what should happen. Chicago\'s and Detroit\'s poverty should be tackled. Doing that would reduce gang violence. Increasing mental health care and including those records into the background checks would prevent a ton of psychos from handling weapons.\nSo, I gave you some reasons, why, and what I think should happen. But you say you have never seen a valid reason. The problem is you might have different beliefs to show you what is valid, while I might see it differently. We both have different views on what is valid. So if you think this isn\'t valid, it might not be to you or many others, but it is valid for me and many others.'),(360793,'Assaultrifles are not necesary.

We wouldn\'t be able to defend ourselves from our own or foreign governments with just assault rifles; they have high grade explosives, tanks, unmanned drones, and heavy weapons like grenade launchers and Gatling guns. Therefore, so we actually can properly defend ourselves in a situation like this, I propose that it be made legal for civilians to purchase and own things like high grade explosives, tanks, unmanned drones, and heavy weapons like grenade launchers and Gatling guns. An assault rifle might allow you to kill a few of the tyrants men; all the other weaponry will allow you to take the fight to the tyrant himself.'),(360799,'Yeah, great.

Guns are a symbol of a human desire to KILL efficiently. It\'s, at it\'s base purpose, not a defensive item. If you want to defend yourself, get a shield.\nSure, it can be used as a weapon, but at least, you can say with conviction that it was created with the intent to defend. You can not defend a gun the same way.\nWhy do you think that captain america\'s shield was his most well known tool? He was a symbol of the DEFENSE of america.

So again, you are back to the only situation in this country where there is a reason for random whoever to have an arsenal, is not self-protection but to impose a minority will on a majority.\n---\nDo you know why the second amendment said \"State\" militia instead of \"federal\"?\nSouthern states wanted to be sure they had the right to form militias to keep any slaves in line who might want to revolt.

It can be applied to individual states, but it was necessary to the security of the country. And slavery may have been an influence, but it wasn\'t a major reason. Just looking at quotes from the founding fathers would disprove that. And the right to bear arms is meant for protection, not oppression. Guns have been satanized by the modern media that it means war, murder, oppression, carnage, and destruction. They do not cause those. Men do. We have the right to bear arms to protect against the natural oppressiveness of man. What we need to fix is what causes these men to do what they do.

So individual states. Are you disagreeing with the intent of the amendment? Or are you misunderstanding it again?\n\nIt was a major reason for southern states though. An entire book has been written on this hold on... found it http://truth-out.org/news/item/13890-the-second-amendment-was-ratified- to-preserve-slavery \n\nNo, a regulated militia is meant for protection and that is all the amendment ever meant, whether that be white slave owners protected from slaves or roving bands of cattle rustlers or whatever. However, police are far more effective in this area and we see clearly that not limiting the fire power of individuals who are not part of some sort of regulated militia directly correlates to how many innocent people are shot with those guns.\n\nNo, men with guns can cause those things. Men without them cannot. More to the point though, those trained are better at preventing those things and as we see, those who are not are more likely to shoot people on accident or go on killing sprees.\n\nHumans are not naturally oppressive. It is a rare thing actually. It just so happens that those who would oppress are the same who also have a higher likelihood to pursue power for power\'s sake.\nThat aside... still. If those people don\'t have guns they are less likely to succeed. Unless it is a government. In which case citizens with guns still don\'t help.\nThe problem is the scenarios which would make unlimited fire power available to all are all ridiculous. It is out of touch with reality and requires a degree of paranoia and delusion.\n\nWhy not fix them all at the same time?\nI love that those who are pro guns are all for paying ridiculous amounts of money to arm and train teachers (whether they want it or not) are the same who don\'t want to pay a penny in taxes to help the mentally ill.\nSo, let\'s compromise. One side agrees to not go ape-shit if the people decide certain guns and certain amounts of ammo are not necessary and background checks required for everyone with a gun, and we can put exactly equal effort into fixing the poverty and mental illness which leads to the use of guns in all of these deaths.\nbtw, that\'s been what gun control has advocated from the beginning.

The United States has one of the strongest militaristic systems in the world. I\'m pretty sure that, in the case of civilians fighting back against the government, the masses would lose. Using the Second Amendment doesn\'t even apply anymore. It was drafted in the 1700s, where technology was limited to basic handguns and rifles, along with the occasional cannon. Times are different. I shouldn\'t have to explain the numerous advances in militaristic technology. The ability to kill is significantly higher. Does this mean that we should just abandon the Second Amendment? Absolutely not, but there should be restrictions on what civilians should be able to possess, otherwise, if you really want to completely follow the amendment, why not just let everyone have whatever firearm they want? I can guarantee that, if everyone possessed a weapon to \"protect themselves\", the mortality rate will rise. One disagreement that gets out of hand can lead to a standoff. Do you really want everyone to have to ability to possess high-capacity magazines with their assault rifles? It\'s just bound to get out-of-hand, no matter how much regulation is done.

Firearms (including air guns) were used in 21,521 recorded crimes. It said that injury caused during a firearm offence was rare with fewer than 3% resulting in a serious or fatal injury.\nIn 2005/6 the police in England and Wales reported 50 gun homicides, a rate of 0.1 illegal gun deaths per 100,000 of population.

I have lived in Britain my entire 21 years of life, and no one I know has ever felt they wished they owned a gun to defend themselves or any other weapon for that matter (I\'ve even lived in east London where gun crime is higher than the rest of England). This gun crime generally stems from \'gangs\' who gain influence from U.S gangs (This is from word of mouth of convicted \'gang\' criminals not assumption or stereotype). I\'m not saying the U.S.A is to blame at all but there is a lot more \'gang crime\' in the U.S than the UK which highly contributes to gun crime.\nMy point is if gun ownership is about defending yourself against someone else with a gun then isn\'t complete gun banning a sensible route to take?

Criminals will find ways to get guns, be it through smuggling, the black market, etc.. You can dispute that all you want, but if you believe in your cited \"home study,\" you will see that there are in fact gun crimes in the UK. So interestingly enough, this notion that banning guns eliminates gun crimes is wrong not only through my arguments, but also through your own.\nSo... murderers, rapists, robbers, and criminals who really want a gun will get a gun.

There would be not 50 gun homicides, but 0 gun homicides. And rather than 6.6% of all homicides making use of a firearm, 0% of homicides would involve firearms.\nNow you\'ll probably wonder, how are gun-related crimes possible when we have a national ban on firearms? Simple: the hard criminals who want to get guns and use them for bad purposes will get them, be it through smuggling, trafficking, the black market, or what have you. The bad guys will get guns and use them for bad things. If I ever come across one of those bad guys, I\'m going to want to have something with a little more \"umph\" than my bare hands to defend myself with.'),(462111,'No, I don\'t believe this, my argument supports that by making guns illegal gun crimes will be reduced not completely halted.

Legal guns become illegal when stolen (\"hot,\" actually,) but some guns are illegal from the get go, shipped here from out of country or illegally procured or produced here. And I don\'t know about it being more difficult. Legal guns are usually more expensive, and there\'s a bunch of background check shit and paperwork and sometimes a waiting period when you go to buy a legal gun; I just need to make a phone call and have a few hundred bucks and I can get an illegal gun.\nAlso according to some info I pulled from the US Department of Justice, only about 8% of violent crime is committed with a gun... where are you getting the 67% figure? My stat was from 2008 but even still I would have a hard time believing it increased 59% in 5 years.'),(496797,'So 10,000 dead people so you can shoot Boar. Got it\n4.2 times more likely to be shot was a statistic from the FBI. And it\'s completely relative to the argument. You say owning a gun makes you safer, from crime and what not. But it doesn\'t, it makes you 4.2 times more likely to be harmed. So you can\'t use defense as an argument.\nI spend half my year in NYC. Hardly Suburbia. Safe city though. Might have to do with the strict gun laws.\nThat\'s not the way we create a society where people don\'t need to rob you. Simply pointing out our efforts maybe better served creating that world instead of shooting anyone who plans to commit crime.\nAnd you\'re right. SOME guns are shipped here from out of country. I guess we shouldn\'t improve anything then lol. I\'m going to lift something from another comedian friend of my Sam Rudykoff. Guns crimes are the only crime that people think they can solve with more of the problem. When kids get molested nobody says we should get more pedophiles. That\'s exactly the line of thinking you\'re subscribing too.\nAnd the statistic about 67% of crime being committed from a gun was from justfacts.com A website someone on your side tried to use against me early. The difference in our stats is that you tried to sneak violent crime in as the same thing. Clever, but I noticed. really that would only leave murder and pistol whipping. Most violent crime is abuse or assault. 67% of crime includes robbery\'s and such. You know, the thing that happened to you.'),(496798,'What do you have against listing all of the things I mentioned? Why do you only list one... is is because it seems like a less significant trade-off if you do it that way?\nAlso, you keep throwing this 10,000 number around, but did you know that .5% statistic you used earlier (a low estimate, btw; some are as high as 3.5%) amounts to 162,000 incidents per year that someone uses a gun to prevent someone from being killed? So ban guns and you might save 10,000; you also kill 162,000.\n\nDid you read my argument at all? Until you link me the statistic we can\'t know if a gun makes you safer from crime or not; perhaps owning a gun just makes you 4.2 times more likely to shoot yourself in the foot, which says nothing at all about a firearms impact on crime. I wasn\'t using self-defense as an argument, I was asking if your argument included self-inflicted injury. And you flat-out refuse to show me the statistic, for some odd reason.\n\nIt doesn\'t really matter if it\'s not suburbia; the point is it\'s safe, and it\'s not like that everywhere. If you\'re safe and protected you probably don\'t feel the need for self-defense; if violence is a real problem around you on a daily basis, you might rethink that position. And I refuse to believe that even national strict gun laws will end violent crime.\n\nFirst of all I would like to clarify that we were talking about shooting someone who was in the act of committing a crime against you, not \"shooting anyone who plans to commit crime.\" Secondly, if that\'s not the way to create a better society, why did you say it was? You offered no way to \"create that world\" other than handing the criminal your wallet.\n\nExcuse me, nowhere in my posts have I made the argument \"we need to solve gun crime/violence with more guns,\" nor is that an argument you will ever hear me make. So putting words in my mouth like that is a blind and baseless assumption (at best) and a deliberate straw man (at worst).\n\nI didn\'t \"try to sneak\" anything; I simply thought a statistic talking about how often guns are used as tools of visual intimidation wouldn\'t do much for your position against violent gun use and crime, so I figured your statistic probably addressed violent crime. I see I was wrong.\nHowever, my statistic: \"Based on survey data from the U.S. Department of Justice, roughly 5,340,000 violent crimes were committed in the United States during 2008. These include simple/aggravated assaults, robberies, sexual assaults, rapes, and murders.[13] [14] [15] Of these, about 436,000 or 8% were committed by offenders visibly armed with a gun.[16]\"\nSo my statistic does include \"robbery\'s and such.\" Y\'know, the thing that happened to me.'),(496799,'Sorry Boars and Angry Deers\nIt\'s 0.5% of gun owners (which should have been obvious. Not everyone.\nAlso it\'s pretty silly to say even those people would all be MURDERED lol.\nYou\'re 4.5 times more likely to be shot. 4.2 times more likely to be killed by one. So not just foot injuries. http://www.newscientist.com/mobile/article/dn17922-carrying-a-gun-increases-risk-of-getting-shot-and-killed.html \nAnd yes NYC is safe. It would be very reasonable to think their strict gun laws help. Unfortunately you seem allergic to logic. So you won\'t put that together.\nIf you want to discuss how to improve society as a whole I think we need a new thread.\nYou say you\'re not for more guns, isn\'t keeping guns legal more guns. You can\'t possible think the entire supply of legal guns in America would be smuggled across borders?'),(496800,'And sport shooting and self-defense. And doomsday preparation. Not just hunting.\nI know it\'s .5% of gun owners; perhaps if more people owned guns, more murders and crimes could be prevented.\nAnd the statistic said, \"at least 0.5% of households had members who had used a gun for defense during a situation in which they thought someone \"almost certainly would have been killed\" if they \"had not used a gun for protection.\" So actually it\'s not silly to think all those people would be murdered; murder was actually specifically what the statistic was addressing.\nYour 4.2 statistic does not include injuries, but it\'s not a survey of gun owners, either; just assault victims. In any case, it\'s still not entirely impressive, just a little more relevant; people who own cars are more likely to be in car accidents than people who don\'t own cars; people who own toasters are more likely to burn themselves making toast than people who don\'t own toasters; people who visit the beach frequently are more likely to drown at sea than people who never go to the beach; people who own firearms are more likely to be shot by firearms than people who don\'t interact with firearms.\nInteresting you seem to think NYC is safe... globally it\'s listed as #7 most victimized city. So maybe it\'s not so illogical I link personal safety to having means of self-defense. Also interesting to note, a lot of the cities with more crime victims are countries with very, very strict gun laws, like Britain.\nWe don\'t need a new thread to discuss how to better society; you specifically said we could better society by handing over our wallets to criminals with guns. That is very relevant to this debate. A bit of a tangent, perhaps, but hardly worth starting a whole new debate over.\nKeeping things the way they are is keeping things the way they are. People crying for gun restrictions are proposing we have less guns. People who want armed guards posted by every school are asking for more guns. I think we should keep things how they are now; restricted, but still with access.\nWhy would I think the entire supply of legal guns here is smuggled across boarders? What did I said to imply that?\nAnd what, you\'re just going to ignore the bit about robberies and 67%? Haha sneaky, sneaky you; luckily I caught it.'),(496801,'Boars and Angry Deer are sports shooting. Also self defense is in Ali\'s do to the 4.2 times statistic remember. Also you never said doomsday prepping because if you did I would have made fun of you for it.\nYah thought someone might have been killed. Have you listened to yourself lol you think you\'re going to be killed at every turn. It\'s part of the gun ownership delusion.\nAnd why is it the gun gets credit for saving you but when it kills someone it doesn\'t.\nAll those things are true. But you don\'t own a toaster and claim its for self defense. My entire point is guns don\'t make you safer. Call it whatever factor you want. It\'s the truth. So they\'re not effective for protection. See section 1. You\'re down to sports shooting and doomsday prepping as your argument. Seems silly doesn\'t it.\nAnd again you find a statistic that is obviously flawed to support your case. NYC is widely considered the safest city in the world. You go and find a total number instead of a per capita statistic. Yes there is probably less crime where you live, there is also 12 million less people.\nIn Britian a guy might beat the piss out of you. But there gun deaths are in the low hundred. AGAIN proving gun laws work.\nAnd if you quote me on everything else and then try to quote me incorrectly. At least make it bold so your lie looks ok. I never said that would make a better society and you know that right. I said it would be more worth while looking to create a society where people didn\'t need to rob you. Instead of just shooting anyone who does.\nKeeping things the way they are is more guns then banning guns. Therefore you feel more guns is the solution to stopping gun crime. You can\'t deny that\'s you entire thesis here\nAnd the reason I said that is because you didn\'t acknowledge that banning guns would mean less guns\nAnd I already cited where I got my stat from. They conflict each other. Do we both wanna pretend we know which source is correct. Because I\'m certain neither of us know.'),(496802,'Okay, sport shooting and hunting and target practice and self defense and doomsday prep. Which is not an invalid reason; governments and countries turn to shit all the time, and it\'s completely realistic to think that there could come a time when the gov/police are unable or unwilling to protect you or are in fact your biggest threat. This happens globally and throughout history with the rise and fall of nations. If some shit like that happens here, chaos and anarchy and riots in the street, it\'s perfectly reasonable to want some firepower.\nHave you listened to yourself? You think someone is going to be killed at every turn. It\'s part of the gun ban delusion.\nI brought up the statistic because you said 10,000 deaths are not an acceptable trade off for all of the things owning guns entails. That includes self-defense. But 162,000 lives are saved every year with firearms. So is 10,000 people dead a good trade off for 162,000 people alive, or would you rather save the 10,000 and let the 162,000 die?\nThe gun doesn\'t get credit for killing someone because you need intent to kill someone and a gun isn\'t the only way to do it; as a weapon and a visual tool of intimidation a gun can allow someone who otherwise wouldn\'t have been able to defend themselves to walk out alive. You can still kill someone without a gun; your intent is more important than your weapon. You cannot always save yourself from someone with a weapon without an equal or better weapon; your weapon is more important than your intent.\nAnd (I\'m going to use the high estimate this time) would you say 972,000 incidents per year that someone saves a live or prevents a murder with a gun means guns are \"not effective for protection?\" Because if almost a million lives saved every year isn\'t support for keeping guns legal, 10,000 (or whatever % of crime) deaths makes absolutely no case for having them banned.\nA total number statistic wouldn\'t tell me what I need to know. A per capita statistic analyzes each person and their experiences, and my source found that NYC had more victimized people. The gun crime rates are low, yes, but crime itself is still prevalent. Again going back to my assertion that banning guns isn\'t the same thing as stopping crime.\n\nMy point in bringing up Britain was to show that, even without guns, crime still happens. Banning guns might reduce the number of people killed by guns, but not killed in general. Kind of like if you banned cars auto-related deaths would drop but bicycle related deaths would go up. London is a city with next to no guns and a fuckton of people victimized by criminals. Perhaps if people in London has the ability to adequately defend themselves; perhaps If a burglar knew breaking into someones flat could very well mean staring down the barrel of a 12gague; perhaps if a mugger knew you could act like you were reaching for your wallet but actually pull out a .22 and shoot his ass; perhaps London would have less crime with more guns.\n\nHere\'s what I said the just of your argument was (notice I didn\'t originally use quotes; I wasn\'t quoting you, I was summarizing your point): \"We don\'t need a new thread to discuss how to better society; you specifically said we could better society by handing over our wallets to criminals with guns\"\nHere\'s the direct quote: \"...a criminal with a gun will shoot some dumb John Wayne who thinks he\'s going to save the day. Give then your $40 keep your life and help create a society that doesn\'t have people who need to rob you instead of arming everyone like its Mad Max.\"\nWith the exception of \"$40\" and \"wallet\" I don\'t see a lot of difference between your quote and my summary of it. Do you?\n\nHow the fuck does that make any sense? If your mom asks if you want second helpings at dinner and you say \"no thanks, I\'m okay with what I have on my plate already,\" are you actually asking for \"more food?\" No. I think things should stay the same; we shouldn\'t be posting armed guards with guns outside schools (more guns) and we shouldn\'t be banning guns (less guns) we should keep things the same (the same amount of relative gun ownership we currently have).\n\nThat\'s because banning something isn\'t the same as making it not exist. Marijuana is illegal, yet it is just as popular and prevalent as alcohol and tobacco, which are legal. Did banning marijuana make marijuana not exist? And, arguably, banning something increases use, and certainly makes illegal use less safe. Look at prohibition. You had people going out to illegal clubs to illegally drink illegal booze, people who arguably wouldn\'t be going out and getting shitfaced if it wasn\'t illegal, and people who are more likely to get hurt by the illegal alcohol culture that the ban on alcohol created.\n\nThe only statistic I found I justfacts that had 67% in it was: \"Roughly 16,272 murders were committed in the United States during 2008. Of these, about 10,886 or 67% were committed with firearms.[11]\"\nCould you post the exact quote that supports your \"67% of crime is committed with a gun\" statistic?\nThe thing is, my 8% statistic comes from the same website. So unless \"nonviolent crime with a gun\" accounts for 59% of crimes committed with a gun (so not simple/aggravated assaults, robberies, sexual assaults, rapes, and murders), you misquoted your stat.'),(496803,'Ok. You don\'t read well\nI think the world is very safe. And that\'s why 10,000 dead people is needless.\nAnd there is no 162,000. That\'s 0.5% of the total population. Which is not the case. It\'s 0.5% of gun owners. Much smaller number. Also whose to say because they felt there lives were threatened if they actually were. People like you think your life is threatened constantly. Pretty flimsy statistic.\nYou can\'t say crime is prevalent in NYC if crime rates are low. That means crime is not prevalent. What is so hard to understand?\nAnd your point about Britian and crime would be valid if the ENTIRE UK had more than 640 murders. By gun fist knife hammer or otherwise. Sounds pretty safe to me.\nAnyone with an above gr 8 comprehension would realize that was not my solution. Your need to harp on this proves how little you have left to stand on.\nYou can grow Marijuana. You let me know when you have a gun plant.\nAlso I\'m against prohibition. But there has never been any prof that MORE people drank because of it. You can\'t just keep making stuff up. I\'ll catch you.\nBanning guns means less guns. Keeping them therefore would be more. If your mom said no dinner! And you said \"one plate!\" That would be more than no dinner right? It\'s pretty simple.\nYou\'re right. The 67% is murders. Doesn\'t that still make the point guns don\'t make us safer. Even 8% of crime in general is a shit ton. That\'s still over 400,000 (8% of 5.1 million) crimes committed with a gun.'),(496804,'I read just fine. You just explain yourself poorly and don\'t support your points well. I also think it\'s pretty rich you\'re assuming me of not reading well when you have severely fucked up your reading and understanding of 2 of the statistics in this debate so far.\n\nBut 162,000 dead is required? And you hardly seem to think the world is a safe place; you seem to think anyone with a weapon is likely to go out and murder everyone.\n\nThe statistic goes as follows: \"A 1993 nationwide survey of 4,977 households found that over the previous five years, at least 0.5% of households had members who had used a gun for defense during a situation in which they thought someone \"almost certainly would have been killed\" if they \"had not used a gun for protection.\" Applied to the U.S. population, this amounts to 162,000 such incidents per year. This figure excludes all \"military service, police work, or work as a security guard.\"[12]\"\nSo it\'s not actually .5% of gun owners have used their gun for defense, it\'s .5% of households have had a member who used a gun to save a life, which when applied to the population comes out to 162,000.\nI would also like to point out that that is 162,000 incidents per year that a gun saves a life; there are 1,029,615 incidents per year (according to the same study) that a gun is used in defense of people or property, but it\'s hard to tell if someone would have certainly been killed in those incidents.\n\nBecause I have statistics that tell me that NYC is the 7th most criminally victimized city in the world, and against that I have your opinion based on spending half the year there.\n\nBy the same study, it\'s not; it\'s the most criminally victimized city in the world. I wasn\'t just talking about murders I was talking about crime.\n\nHahahaha well not all of us are privy to what you were trying to say; all we can examine is what you actually did say. Again this seems to be a case of you expressing yourself poorly and getting upset when people don\'t understand. I\'m all ears; if that\'s not what you meant to say you can amend your statement and we can discuss that. And I\'m hardly \"harping on this;\" it account for a very small portion of our debate. But I think its relevant to see how you handle defeat on the small issues, like this one, because that tells me how you debate in general. If I win a small point like this and you get butthurt and refuse to explain or support your position, much less admit you were wrong, what does that say about your style of debating as a whole? Nothing good, that\'s for sure, and it indicates you wont concede points on the basis that they are your points, not that they are actually correct.\n\nWhat a spectacular dodge. Way to completely miss the point in me bringing up weed, man.\n\nAnd you can\'t keep repetitiously building up your own straw men, passing them off as mine, and then attacking them and thinking you\'ve made a point; I\'ll catch you. I never said there was \"prof\" more people drank (it would have been impossible to calculate, anyways) during prohibition.\n\nI have one gun.\nIf a ban on guns goes through and I comply, I will have no guns. (Less guns)\nIf things stay the way they are, I will have one gun. (The same)\nIf I go buy more gun(s), I will have more than one gun. (More guns)\nWhy is this so hard for you to understand?\n\nI stand corrected you do know how to concede a point... kinda. Lol. Well a woefully small percentage of crime is committed with a gun, and even the total amount of that small percentage doesn\'t compare the the number of times guns are used in self defense, so I think the point can be made that guns make us safer.'),(496805,'The insanity to think that all those people\'s lives were actually in jeopardy is hilarious. You\'re trading REAL lives for hypothetical crime. Again! Owning a gun makes you 4.5 times more likely to be shot. Therefore! Those 0.5% are still not safer. While that is a fact, there is no self defense argument. You Are Not Safer Statistically!\nAlso, NYC is the safest city in the world by per capita crime. Yes there is more crime than Augusta Georgia, but the population is 100 times more. You can\'t refute this.\nLike I said about Britian. You might catch an ass whooping. Which btw has much more to do with the culture than gun laws. But point is, they don\'t have guns SO THEY DON\'T DIE. Stats again prove it. You have no applicable data that doesn\'t rely on the opinion of gun owners. That 0.5% is not a fact. It\'s an opinion. There is no way to prove there life was in danger.\nLOL and the fact you think you\'ve defeated anything is hilarious to me. You\'ve yet to prove once that guns have helped in any tangible way.\nAnd I\'m not but hurt. You tried to misrepresent what I said because you have no leg to stand in.\nAgain on weed. You ignore the fact your point is baseless. It\'s a completely different scenario. If you could find a proper example you would.\nIf you do the math, the amount of crime committed with a gun is much greater. 8% of 51 million crimes is 400,000. 0.5% of imaginary life saving is 162,000. The numbers are right there for you. And one of them is based in facts not opinions of already nervous weirdos.'),(496806,'Rob loves to argue, but he\'s not very good at it.\nCome back when you\'re willing to address all the points I make and not pick and choose certain ones you think you can refute. Ignoring the 1,000,000+ statistic, for example (because it is tangible and not reliant on the opinion of gun owners) so you can say my self-defense statistics are based on paranoid delusions. You have such an obvious bias against gun owners (thinking being a gun owner makes you a \"nervous wierdo,\" for example) perhaps you ought to work to eliminate that before you can participate in a logical debate about gun facts.'),(496807,'So that stat isn\'t based on opinion of gun owners?

You could not EASILY kill someone with your fingers, hands, feet or any limb.

You have to pick one, apparently.\nIt might take a bit more premeditation to kill someone without a gun (unless you happen to have a car or a knife or some wire handy), but I don\'t know about FAR more.

But it isn\'t the \'Gun\' that is doing the killing! It its the person who wields the gun! They should be the ones taken out of society, not the gun itself. Do they honestly think getting rid of guns will solve anything? Granted the fact that the one thing it will be successful in is enraging many Americans. And since when do Criminals follow the law anyways? There is a reason they are criminals! Banning the sale of guns is not going to stop them! If they want to kill they are not going to simply think to themselves \"Oh you know what, guns are banned, therefore I really shouldn\'t kill all these people\" NO. That\'s not how it works. If they are twisted enough to want to murder people in the first place, then they will find a way around the law. They could care less about what the government says. Americans have the right to own guns. In fact, the majority of us use them for the GOOD. They can actually PROTECT us from those who use them to induce harm. So that is my opinion.

You only use them when it serves your flawed argument.'),(496847,'Back then the idea of a free market and economic choice held validity, simply stating that some of those ideas are not longer useful does not make any argument to support an idea from that time period to be invalid. It would be like claiming that none of Plato\'s or Socrates\' logic has any validity now because they believed in slavery (had it at the time)\nNow if you would like to present an actual argument about gun control besides \"that guy has wooden teeth and slaves\" please go ahead and do so.'),(496848,'First of all. Maybe you do live like 1776 because you\'re boring and take yourself too seriously. You presented a sentence uttered by a man who owned other men as an argument for gun ownership, not me. I would never use anecdotal quotes from ghosts as my arguments, you sir are the one who has done this.\nI don\'t think it\'s irrational to think that getting your gun laws from a time when guns were muskets is naive. If George Washington were here to see the guns we have now he\'d swallow his wooden teeth and shit them out for his slave too clean up.'),(496849,'I quoted someone on gun ownership, NOT slavery, gun ownership is not related to slavery so his position on slavery is meaningless.\nBecause guns became more high-tech? Weaponry becoming more advanced is not grounds to ban it and take it away. Controlling guns is not being anti-gun, its just centralizing gun power, so instead of citizens and the government being able to defend themselves, only the government can. At this point the citizens are now dependent on their government for protection and are also at the states absolute mercy considering the people are completely disarmed.'),(496850,'Yah and his views on gun ownership are as irrelevant as his views on slavery. You are the one that presented them as an argument. I pointed out how stupid that was.\nAnd you don\'t think there is a difference between owning a musket and an assault rifle?\nWe are at the governments whim regardless. You really think because you have a gun, you\'d have a chance. They control water, electricity, and they have more guns then you and all your militia friends could every jerk off too.\nIt\'s probably fun to play commando in your head like one day you\'ll fight off Obama and his evil henchman. But that\'s just paranoid delusion. In the meantime real people are dying for your fantasy.'),(496851,'Stand a chance against the US Marine Corp.? No. Stand a chance against weekend soldiers that make up most of the army? Actually, yes.\nIts not some fantasy, I\'ve hear this clause before and it basically boils down to this idiotic idea that somehow rebellion is impossible. People don\'t die because there are guns, they die because people are violent. Millions of people have died over this \"only the government should have guns\" fantasy of yours, that\'s still leaving out law abiding citizens that are now vulnerable to criminals. You want to know why burglary rates are low in the US? Because criminals know that if they break into that house, these is a good chance the owner has a gun and will fight back.\nGuns are protection, when they are used violently it is not grounds to take the guns away from everyone else who didn\'t nothing wrong.'),(496852,'First of all, do you think it would really be weekend warriors. We don\'t even use troops to kill people now we use drones strikes. So you can Will Smith all you want but it\'s pointless.\nAnd I\'m not saying rebellion is impossible. I\'m saying its not necessary. Obama isn\'t out to get you.\nAnd owning a gun doesn\'t make you safer. You\'re 88% more likely to be shot if you own a gun. Does that sound safe?\nWE are not violent, YOU are violent. You have violent delusions and the result is far too often a bunch of innocent dead people. If you believe the government that provides all they do is against you then you can think anyone is.'),(496853,'Whoever said this is because of Obama?\nAnd owning a gun does not somehow make you more likely to get shot. Unless you:\na. Live in a police state where guns are illegal\nb. Pretend to be the sandy hook shooter\nc. Point it at your face\nHow do I have violent delusions? My \"delusion\" is that people should have the right to bear arms to defend themselves from criminals and if the government becomes brutality violent they can shoot back. This idea hasn\'t killed anyone, the idea that guns need to be taken away has left people at the mercy of tyrannical governments and criminals, that has killed people.\nAnd as for drones, drones are expensive and have lots of collateral damage, causing collateral damage (from the government\'s perspective) on their own land, own people and own means of production is a REALLY fucking stupid idea.'),(496854,'Yes it does make you (88%) more likely to be shot. You can\'t say disagree with a statistic with your opinion. Most people have no idea what they are doing with guns. They shoot themselves. They commit suicide but most importantly they cause other people who have guns too kill them instead of rob them. Which is exactly what happens when you \"defend\" yourself. Someone breaks into your home, you think \"Finally, my chance!\" And as you go for your gun you are killed in the most anti climatic way ever. That\'s the fate of your defence.\nThe idea you need to protect yourself from the government is the violent delusion.\nA) It would obviously be violent if you need guns.\nB) The idea you need to battle the government is delusional.\nHence = Violent Delusions\nAnd yes the idea has killed people. In fact over 100,000 people in America every year die for your delusion.\nAnd if the government wants you dead and you need guns, why would they give a shit about collateral damage.'),(496855,'You really believe the government is all powerful? Like if they wanted you dead, they could do it with a snap of their fingers? They don\'t have that power. They can\'t just do things whenever they feel like it. If they did, they would be just like Stalin, Hitler, Mao Ze Dong, Kim Jong Ill/Un, Castro. They killed more people than the entire holocaust multiplied a few times. And EVERY single country they were in didn\'t allow the citizens to own firearms. If we are as violent as you say we are, all of you Liberal anti-gunners would be dead a long time ago. We want to protect your freedoms, even if you don\'t appreciate it. The FBI, police, and the states say that letting citizens own guns decreases crime. There is actually a town in Georgia that requires every one in the town to own a firearm. Their population tripled in 20 years, their crime went down to almost nothing. Every single school that allows concealed carry on campus or for the teachers has NEVER had a shooting and crime was reduced. And you think that we enjoy the chance to kill someone? No one wants to kill anybody. Only the mentally insane and criminals do. Killing is not a thing to enjoy nor worship. It is a deplorable thing. I would kill only if that someone threatened my life or that of someone around me. And to show in statistics, self-defense cases show only a percentage of less than 1% of people actually pulled the trigger, most just threatened and presented the weapon against the intruder (FBI). That was enough to scare the criminal. Please look up facts before making assumptions. It shows your ignorance on the matter and the propaganda pumped into you. The FBI site is a great place to start, as well as the CATO Institue.'),(496856,'Ok so we need to be more free like the non oppressive governments in the Middle East that allow citizens to carry fire arms.

Maybe stricter gun laws did help, but also the increased activity and push by Police did most of the work. And your WSJ gave the opinion that the national average of gun crime has gone down, yet gun ownership is up. And it also stated that the entire thing can\'t be credited on gun laws. Health care, decreased poverty, and education were the majority. I would say that the majority of this was because of the other factors, not gun laws.'),(496858,'Well lets be fair WSJ narrative is going to be pro gun. It\'s a Murdoch paper. And what about Cananda.

Collateral damage would destroy industry and infrastructure, anyone accidental killed in the collateral damage will server as something for other people to rally around. It works the same way in Afghanistan, they use a drone to kill one \"terrorist\" they injure/kill a kid that was near the explosion, now his parents and friends will most likely take up arms.\nAre you starting to understand? Collateral damage works against them, it takes out 1 threat but at the same time has a large potential to create more (especially in a urban area) and at the same time it is damaging their own infrastructure and industry.\nIts not about being polite, its about fighting smart, using drones would not be a good move.'),(496870,'First of all.

I\'m not saying \"well, the government will fight gentleman\'s style\" I\'m saying that any somewhat intelligent military understand who this works.\nAs for the whole \"this century\" thing that is only a 13 year period, so that kind of gets Hitler, Stalin, Zedong, Pol etc.\nBut anyway, what about the Winnende Shooting in Germany?

People like this do not supply the black market in significant numbers, as most gun owners are not this irresponsible, although a lot of illegal guns are stolen and straw purchases. But nonetheless, it really makes no difference where they come from because as long as there is a demand, there will be a supply, if they can no longer steal guns, they will illegally import them, if they can no longer import them they will fabricate them themselves. Don\'t think that is possible, then you are very ignorant of reality because they can fabricate fully automatic assault rifles in third world countries with primitive tools and skills, and I have even seen cases of people making a .22 handgun in a state prison.\nThis argument is so exhausted there\'s no other word for it than stupid.

If there were no consequences to gun ownership, I would certainly support allowing all guns everywhere. But there are consequences. Guns kill people just like fists kill people, except it is much easier to erroneously kill/injure with a gun.\nI dispute the claim of self-defense rights. It is indisputably safer to not own a gun than to own a gun, save for the rare case when the area is so dangerous that using the gun to save oneself is statistically more likely than using it to kill oneself/others, on accident or otherwise. And all of these special cases exist only because guns exist in the first place. Remove them all and violence drops dramatically (after all, there is no such thing as a drive-by knife fight).\nThe mission to remove guns from the streets is akin to the drive to promote world peace. In fact, they are essentially the same thing. Although promoting peace can have consequences (often, it creates conflict) the less war there is the better. It is the same with guns. The unique factor that makes guns, like war, so worth fighting against is that they cause significant collateral damage. They fuel drug cartel violence, they contribute to accidental deaths and suicides, and they often kill innocent bystandards. Other weapons? Not so much.\nThe attempt to ban guns begins at the supreme court. The 2nd ammendment must be re-interpreted under its primary intention, \"militia.\" Militia, in today\'s speak, means locally stationed military, or just military. If reinterpreted correctly, this law does not protect gun owners.\nNext, the federal government would coordinate with states to completely eliminate all production of new guns in the country, and ban the importation. This would stifle the supply to almost zero.\nFinally, gun buyback programs and phased-in laws against gun ownership would slowly remove the remaining guns.\nThis would require a lot of effort, and a lot of redneck outrage, but it would all be worth it in the long run. To the few people every year who get attacked by people and theroretically could have saved themselves if they had a gun (and also the assailant did not have a gun (and the victim could not have just defended with a knife)), sorry.

Rather than this guns aren\'t used for anything else. While committing a murder with a knife or a bat is considered a misconduct, guns where only designed to kill. Knives and bats were developed for other causes rather than killing. But guns aren\'t used in any other way. In addition guns are even more lethal than knives because one can accidentally kill someone due to uncontrollable firing. This especially applies to assault rifles and submachine guns that fire multiple rounds per pulling the trigger. Where as with a knife only one person can be targeted. Another point for the gun ban is that people with criminal intentions can easily get access to guns and weapons. America has seen this during the past 20 years the gang violence the frequent gun-related homicides and the brutal massacres such as columbine, Virginia Tech and now New Town Connecticut. By giving these people (or any people at all) access to these weapons multiple people can be killed in just a matter of seconds and most importantly guns can be acquired legally. But for what cause? What could you possibly need a gun for? For hunting but only with a license and any deliberate murder would be considered a misconduct because hunting rifles where intended to kill animals and that is a legitimate cause for killing. But since cannibalism is extremely scarce people say they need guns for protection. But from what? There\'s the police there\'s the FBI that protect but just normal residents why do they need guns. Every single time people have a conflict they don\'t try to peacefully solve the problem. A lot of them would just go crazy, grab their gun and start shooting at the other person they were having their conflict with. If they wouldn\'t have guns they might think two more times before reverting to the gun. People always think violence is the answer I can assure you it isn\'t and those that think violence isn\'t caused by guns but by people they should know that guns foster this violence and even intensify it on a catastrophic scale. The worst part of all is that because of the gun sales and the simplicity of acquiring a weapon, criminal organizations are heavily benefiting from this as well. The Sinaloa cartel and various street gangs can simply order people to purchase weapons for them. If the opportunity weren\'t there it would be much more difficult for criminal organizations to acquire them. However criminal organizations can still smuggle weapons and get assault weapons but the ban on weapons could lower the murder rate and hinder organizations from bulking up with annihilating firepower. We should act fast and realize that we are protecting ourselves from the same thing that is supposed to protect us. Guns are wrong and we need to find an alternative method. The constant killing has got to stop!'),(513082,'As a human I am disgusted as to the fact that people still want to buy guns despite the amount of death they cause. First let me say I am not against the sale of select weapons for hunting and farmers but no one else needs weapons and certainly no one needs fully automatic carbines or 12 gauge shotguns, why would anyone need weapons that are close to and are in some cases military grade?? The line \"guns don\'t kill people, people do\" is quite ridiculous as an argument for gun sales since it is \"people\" that the guns are being sold to!! It is just a case of prevention, remove guns being so easily accessible and you then decrease the gun crime and remove the need for guns to defend yourself.

The true is that even if you had your two or three guns in a massacres you wouldnt be able to use any of those without to take a good part of the mass killing.

If he wasn\'t able to get a gun, all those kids would be alive today, except maybe one. If gun owners would think of that, instead of there own selfish desires to have a gun, alot of children would still be alive today. Reports show that a small percentage of gun owners actually use a gun to defend themselves, there are more killed with a gun, than those using a gun to protect themselves, they cain\'t say it\'s used for selfdefense. with all the guns in the hands of so called law abiding citizens, why are so many children massacred today? where are they using there guns to protect?

If you believe in a higher power there is no reason to be scared. If it the spirit within us all is collective than you really don\'t have anything to fear but fear itself.\nAs far as one post stating if we all had money and the basic essentials than there would be no reason for guns... I think this sentiment is spot on. NOBODY ever discusses the real reason criminals have guns. There are too many to name, but they all usually go back to an unhealthy relationship to money and greed in our society, the paper chase. I\'m not saying we need to be communists. Even ancient Rome fed it\'s peasants in the street. There is a civic as well as a spiritual responsibility we have towards mankind. We are all on the same side here. Our individual salvation depends on our collective salvation. You can\'t keep killing the problem. You must educate and preserve life.\nOn a small scale guns could be replaced with Tasers and other close range defense mechanisms. Guns initial purpose was to defend against the tyranny of government by forming militia. Which I would argue a gun or semi automatic won\'t do much against our current military. The 2nd Amendment is dated to say the least. It was meant for defending against Indians and the British. I\'m pretty sure the peaceful education of our enemies and ourselves has turned these foes into our brothers.\nThe world is more educated than ever... and there are social networking sites and the internet which can disseminate information faster than ever. We can either be part of a global arms race and kill ourselves or we can seek virtue, truth, and education in order to live in harmony.\nI will add that GUNS aren\'t really the issue at hand. It\'s a disconnection to our spirituality. And not a religious spirituality, a mankind spirituality that connects us all.

I know the other side goes on about having \"a right to bare arms\", which is all well and good, but having studied american history, it is easy to see that the main reason guns and possibly the creed \"a right to bare arms\" itself existed as America was an incredibly lawless place at one time, and so people needed to have their own means of protection.

Rarely is it so one sided. Why do people fixate on one topic? To focus on one issue as the core is illogical.\n1) First note, yes, guns can kill people, but ultimately people kill people. Basic logic. This is an argument of purpose and existence. Just because something exists doesn\'t mean it has purpose, and if an object has purpose it has existence. What is the purpose of the firearm? Many. Yes, killing is one of them, but there are so many others (for example, the enjoyment of shooting large pumpkins...and yes, I do). Equally so, I could argue that as a human, you were created to breed and kill on the whole in order to survive as the fittest, but modern theories and cognition seem to provide a greater degree of purpose to humanity. Of course, most of it is BS.\n2) Equating lower crime rates due to the ban of guns is absurd. Japan has a peaceful society because after World War 2, and as terms of their surrender, many impositions were put on them. As such, the country turned inward and began the foundation of modern Japan. Make no mistake, guns or not, the Japanese were not exactly the epitome of peace up until recent times. The idea of self is not priority to the Japanese. Subsequently, this level of stress in Japan has given them the highest suicide rate in the world. Death by gun? probably not. Death by , sure! Key topic here, death.\nThe UK with it\'s gun ban has seen a healthy increase in knife violence. From what I also read, gun crimes actually went up as well (yes, the nasty black market). But if you look at most statistics, the majority of these crimes are concentrated in heavily populated areas (this seems to corroborate with worldwide trends.). See my argument #1...people kill people, especially when you cram them in a small, stinky space. Human nature. Take away one thing, we\'ll either find it another way or find a substitute.\n3) The Constitution. The right to bear arms has been beaten to death. The 2nd amendment was created in order to have a readily available militia, amongst a other minor things. Home defense? sure, why not. The gun nuts (and I do own guns) tend to use this as a giant hammer, crying to the call of freedom. Ridiculous. Get over it. It\'s ok to say \"I shoot guns because it\'s fun and makes me happy\". No shame in that.\nThe ultimate issue is a Pandoras box, which actually applies to all kinds of ideas and objects. An idea or object is released to the world, and we want to tuck it away never to be seen again. This is setting everyone up for failure.

The only restriction on whether a person can own a gun should be passing a gun safety course.\nA shotgun has many uses, and in many ways a shotgun would be a better self-defense weapon than a handgun it has significantly more stopping power and is much harder to conceal.\nIf you have your shotgun with you then it\'s a lot of help. There is a significant number of people in the US that carry weapons in their cars for just the sort of situation you describe. That is also the reasoning behind obtaining a concealed carry permit.\nFinally you bring up societies mistreatment of people. I honestly believe that people\'s lack of education and even to some extent poverty is more often than not a result of their own failings. I would be remiss to say that all poverty was something that those stricken by it brought it upon themselves but many poverty stricken people perpetuate their status. More importantly a lack of scholarly education or wealth is no excuse for going on a crime spree.\nIn short I\'ll fall back on the tried and true motto, \"Guns don\'t kill people, people kill people.\" It\'s hard to argue with that logic, modern guns have so many safeguards built in that it is not often that they go off without someone pulling the trigger and never if it\'s not loaded.'),(513148,'mmm, yes, If we take Switzerland as an example again, they have compulsory consription for all young men where they learn about their automated weapons, discipline, responsibility and all that jazz. It also effectively renders the entire able bodied male population of Switzerland potential, trained militia. Service is optional for women there. Prehaps an educational camp is what is needed for responsible gun ownership.'),(513149,'I just want to clarify one point. you are aware that semi-automatics are just guns that reload once after shooting, not guns that can shoot two or more bullets per trigger pull, right? Because the latter is illegal in the US and in most places. (well not exactly, you can legally own burst-firing and even full autos in some states but it\'s a long and expensive process). Also the large majority of guns owned are semi-autos. And one more thing shotguns are probably the best guns for hunting any fowl.'),(513150,'Ever heard of target shooting or hunting? Also what if you have a varmint problem? And even if you ban guns criminals can still buy guns illegally and then the only people with guns would be criminals...and the police, but what if the police aren\'t around shouldn\'t you have the right to defend yourself? Also guns don\'t mean that people are more likely to commit crime or even kill people. Look at Switzerland, they have the second highest gun ownership rate in the world (second only to the USA), and a large percentage of those are government issued assault rifles, yet they have a much lower crime rate than the US. The problem isn\'t guns it\'s poverty and lack of education we should be working on those instead of blaming guns for all our problems.'),(513151,'Shot guns are used for many different application a few of which are bird hunting like pheasant or ducks, they can also be used for trap and skeet shooting. Another thing shotguns have a maximum shot distance of 30 yards so they aren\'t that good of a weapon. Also semi-automatic weapons have various uses and when you are hunting fast animals you want to be able to take as many shots as possible without having to cock the gun. Another point is that a gun is a tool and the person is the one who kills someone not the gun. And it is now required to take firearm safety to purchase or use a gun and also 80% of guns used in crimes are bought illegally according to the FBI.'),(513152,'\"The british aren\'t going to invade, so we don\'t need to protect ourselves\".

You either want to use that body bag or you don\'t.\n3) Guns in America was not meant for hunting as a primary purpose. It is your second amendment right / duty to have one as our founding fathers have seen how government abuses its power to fellow citizens. Government should serve people, not the other way around.\n4) People kill people , not tools kill people. You say all you want that these equipment make it easier for bad people to do harmful things. However, would you also want to get rid of chances for law abiding citizen to defense themselves. If you say the cops can do it then you are delusional. They don\'t have the jurisdiction to even search you or run to your house to do things on your property. Go find out about the law.\n5) Countries that have extremely strict gun laws don\'t really work well either. Japan still has high crime rates, they just hide their news. People still kill each other in many different ways.\n6) I do agree with fully automatic weapons can be ridiculous since you cannot hit anything accurately and should just spread the harm. However, having a regular semi-automatic firearms should not be excluded in any state or the country. I suggest you go learn about firearms really well before you say stuff.\n7) Law enforcement do agree that black rifles do not create crimes.

Also now they have far better intelligence technology than during the Vietnam war.\nBefore Vietnam and Korea the American armed forces did not have to deal with a solely guerrilla war and thus were not as prepared as they are now.\nLastly, no matter if the rebelling side is using peaceful means or armed as it appears you are supporting, there will be excessive bloodshed.

Then compare it to areas with less gun control laws, such as Texas and Arizona (where concealed carry permits are fairly easy to obtain). The difference is huge because criminals are far less likely to commit a crime if they think that the victim could be armed.\nTheir was also a study (I don\'t have the link handy) that showed that the majority of violent crimes involving guns, the gun that was used by the criminal was obtained illegally. That\'s what criminals do, they break the law. If someone is really going to commit a crime with a gun, then why would they choose to obey any gun control laws?\nI believe that Thomas Jefferson said it best when he said, \"Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.\"'),(513238,'I\'ve been on both sides of this argument and I can certainly sympathize with the respective positions.\nI\'ve always found it interesting that liberal argument on gun control is seen to be derived from a presupposition that individuals cannot act responsibly with the possession of firearms while at the same time assuming that collective bodies of individuals (such as our federal government) can be or is a organization that will responsibly conduct legislation and execute public policy and laws to the betterment of the public good.\nOn the other side, the conservative argument proceeds from both the standpoint that the individual can act responsibly with a firearm and/or (agreeing somewhat with the liberal basis) does not want to be found without a firearm in the company of irresponsible individuals who are carrying guns. It is also interesting that the former basis for the conservative argument assumes that the right to bare arms is the responsible individuals right to protect themselves against a hypothetical attack or control of an irresponsible collective body of individuals (a empire or dictatorship or oppressive government.)\nTo a certain extent, you have to identify the motive driving your position, whether it be fear of our government or trust in our government, and determine the extent to which that motive might be hindering your ability to critically evaluate the opposing argument fairly in light of your own.\nPersonally, I don\'t think banning the purchase and use of firearms in the United States will do anything to lessen the crime rates in our country. As has been stated already in this forum, the gun market will continue regardless of federal policy. Also, we\'ve nurtured a culture of hopelessness and violence in our country that (while it may not be root cause of the problem) has certainly not helped the conditions that drive a person to resort to violent recourse to deal or cope with certain circumstances where better opportunities, financial security, or a better education might help them to make more responsible decisions.\nI realize that I\'m being horribly idealistic here (as I\'m often accused of being) but I feel that a better public education system, a more dynamic economy, and a more promising future for the people of our country will do much more than taking the guns out of all the sock drawers in the U. S. of A.\nAnd, the argument that it works in Britain fails to address the geographical size difference between North America and the British Isles, the demographic diversity, the population counts, and the cultural conflicts that distinguish the two nations.\nTighter restrictions on gun purchases and ownership are definitely necessary.

Not every member of the military is a brainwashed drone who will follow any order given to them without thought. But considering that there are many more civilians than there are members of the military would make things difficult for the military. Plus think about the police departments, they can provide a lot of help in a situation where civilians will need defense. It doesn\'t take long to train someone how to defend themselves with a gun.

Criminals have different intents, anywhere from your money to your life. Your life is a potential target no matter what the intent is. Would you rather be mangled, mutilated, and murdered or have to explain why you shot that thug in the chest?

The same thing is going on for marijuana, cocaine, and meth, and the method of sale and purchase is no different for guns. How? Because drugs are illegal, and if guns are too, then they will just be circulated the exact same way.\nClearly we can\'t trust our the people and criminals with guns, but we can trust them to follow the laws?

In fact, if we force everyone to carry a .40 s&w;than crime rates will drop dramatically. My question is, as a criminal, will you attempt to kill someone if everyone else in sight is carrying a large handgun? a .40 S&W;is a large handgun, and will drop the toughest people in 3 shots. Something else you must keep in mind is that if we outlaw guns, the only people with guns will be outlaws, this leaves no defense for law abiding citizens. Now on to several specific types of guns these idiots wish to outlaw. Shotgun: A shotgun is not concealable, no one carrying a shotgun is going to get very far before being detained, or with the \"shall carry\" law, possibly shot. A shotgun does way too much damage for you to carry it into public with positive intents. Anyone who kills a shotgun wielder can get away with the third degree. Next semi auto: semi-auto is used by people wishing to reduce recoil, people hunting with poor aim, or someone who needs self defense. Finally the AK: Someone said you don\'t need an AK to take out a deer, first of all, the AK is a semi-auto weapon if it is legal. Second, the 7.62x39 shell is considered small for a deer, yes that is right, the AK-47 is a small gun. Third, it is very reliable. People want AK-47s so they can literally bury them in sand when things are peaceful, dig them out, and shoot them when things get bad. Fourth: it is a collectors item. Anyone who supports the banning of guns doesn\'t know enough about them to make an informed opinion, and isn\'t willing to learn more, and would rather live in ignorance than try to correct their views. As a side note, all of you tote your numbers. Whether the U.S.A. has the highest gun death rate of all countries, I don\'t know, many of these numbers are incorrect. Still, if we ban guns, and get every gun off the streets, people will find something else to kill each other with, I could kill someone with a rose if I wanted. Either way, if the U.S.A.\'s numbers are as high as you claim it is because you can not kill someone with a gun with a dagger, so instead of going with the dagger, more people go with the gun.'),(513314,'Even if guns are outlawed, they would be smuggled in like any other drug. so outlawing guns won\'t make much of difference except it will be harder to get guns, besides guns are also used for sports so why ban them?'),(513315,'I think if u have to ban a gun for ,excuse my language, retards kiling peouple.The goverment should step in and watch better ill postt more later.:)'),(513316,'.exeactlyyyy f it wasnt for smelly old retardsssss usingg gunss they way they arent ament to be used then they wouldnttt need to beee banned no wittt am sayingggggg LAD\'SSSSSSS!!!!!!'),(513317,'aye dee we kno wit yer sayien likeeee (L)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'),(513318,'.gladddd someoneee n\'att doesss josieeeee maaa mannoo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'),(513319,'hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!xxxxxxxxxxxx'),(513320,'Ever since the dawn of time mankind has killed each other, Cain killed Abel, he didn\'t use a gun.

Most of you on the other end of this debate probably never touched a gun, much less shot one before, and base your opinion on the decision that you simply have no use for them. Deer have to be taken down with an arrow or bullet to be field dressed or taken to a processor. Cows are different; they\'re stupid and will just walk right into the butcher shop.

I live in an area where people get murdered about as often as a lunar eclipse occurs, but I always keep a pistol close by. It\'s better to have it and not need it, than to need it and not have it! Children brought up around guns have considerably more respect for them. When you hear of kids finding a gun and one shoots the other by mistake, I think of a yankee that never showed it to them, or taught them safe handling and I imagine he never shot it himself. If you are satisfied with the thought of curling up in a ball when an intruder crashes through your front door, by all means do. But, they are going to kill you if they want to. If somebody breaks through my door, I\'m going to shoot them, and then ask them why they didn\'t knock. You can have my guns when you pry them from my cold dead fingers. People are just generally better once you leave the city. Sure, there are still people living off of the system, but mostly people around here have to work to survive. It seems much easier for a criminal living in the city to kill and steal there, and walk around the corner to make a buck off the treasures obtained. God blessed texas!

Europe is not at all comparable to the US in this regard for two main reasons.\nFirst and foremost is the power the government holds vs the territory they have to enforce regulations upon. The United States represents a territory comparable to all of Europe combined. Gun enforcement represents a logistical nightmare at the federal level that nothing in all of Europe comes anywhere near to approaching. In order to be remotely comparable, we\'d have to be comparing individual States within the US with nations in Europe, and that simply falls flat- from one end, our state governments have significantly less power and infrastructure to utilize said power than national governments in Europe do, and are further curtailed by the division of power between the state and federal governments. A categorical gun ban within the US would be all but impossible to enforce.\nSecondly is the culture (as well as criminal culture) within the regions. Already, with firearms being generally legal within the US, we have a significantly larger black market weapons trade within our borders, again, than all of Europe combined. Basic supply and demand applies here- there is simply more demand for firearms, legal or illegal, within the United States than there is within Europe. Banning guns will in fact increase the demand for illegal firearms, driving up prices and attracting further suppliers. This is not speculation, but extrapolation of what we\'ve already seen within the few regions within the US where firearms are actually illegal (which amounts mainly to a handful of cities at current).\nIn short, Europe is overall better equipped to regulate firearms than the US is due to enjoying both a lower demand for firearms and more potency within the government to police things at the local level.\nIf you\'d like to contest some of my points specifically, feel free to do so. But a one-off \'look at Europe\' completely lacking in details and specifics does not dispute what I\'ve asserted in any way.\nEurope is also a bad comparison because many of the nations in Europe have significantly more crime per capita than the United States do.

HOWEVER, just because a violent crime is done with a gun doesn\'t mean the guns being legal have CAUSED the homicide.\nSome Social Psychologists try to point to the idea that guns remove a bit of intimacy from killing another human being, which has some truth to it. It is far harder to stab a person to death than shoot them if you are not the killing type.\nSo what does the data suggest about gun control? According to justthefacts.org, guns are heavily used in areas that allow them. HOWEVER, gun bans and restrictions do not reduce homicide rates. They lower the percentage done by guns, but violent crime rates have spiked heavily in DC, Britain, and Chicago after enacting gun restrictions and bans.\nAs for allowing citizens to carry a firearm, Florida had a significant decrease in murder rates, while Texas and Michigan had a minor decrease.\nDespite the facts, some still try to argue for gun control or tight restrictions, including the idea that guns lead to fatal accidents. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the amount of accidents outweigh the amount of defenses. In fact, fatal gun accidents only account for about .5% of the total fatal accidents in the United States. This is something to greatly consider especially since the US is greatly criticized for having generally laxed gun laws.\nThe Second Amendment itself was put in place not just to have the citizens to defend themselves when government can\'t, but to keep the population armed and dangerous in case the government ever overstepped its bounds.

The reason a country has a nuke is not to use it but rather to create a sense of \"don\'t mess with me or I will ruin your day.\"\nThere is an old concept that is a very effective deterrent. It\'s called Assured Mutual Destruction, (AMD). Basically, you might get me, but I\'ll get you too. Guns create this effect. Someone might bring a gun into a crowded place but if that person knew that say 10% of the people had guns, he/she would look for a different target.\nSoft targets are more responsible for murder and death then guns. A killer goes in a house with a knife, why, because he has profiled the place and has assumed that the person would not have a gun. Maybe not even a knife, but some sleeping agent.\nCars and \"legal drugs\" kill far more people then guns. And often with intent, but usually when someone is murdered with a car the victim isn\'t in a car but on foot. Again, the issue is the soft target. More rarely, when someone kills with a car, they don\'t risk hitting a moving car, because of AMD.\nAbout 50% of people killed with guns do it themselves. There are many people that are to scared to kill themselves so they do what is a called, \"Suicide By Cop\" (SBC). Basically, they get a gun and challenge a cop and is killed by police acting in self-defense. Another point that isn\'t taken in consideration in the stats that I\'ve seen is that guns are used in self-defense but it still goes down as \"gun violence.\"\nThere are dogs that can be deadly. Cars. Drugs. Icy Sidewalks. Ski Slopes. Swimming. Sun Tanning. Beer drinking. Lighting farts on Fire. Heaters. Extension Cords. Bicycles. Hot Dogs. Hot Wheels. Band Camp. . . . actually, that was something else. Going to work in high towers.\nMy point is: Life is a dangerous. The point of guns isn\'t to kill others as much as it to defend self. Women don\'t carry guns in their purse because they \"want\" to kill someone, but rather they don\'t want someone to \"kill them.\"\nAnd lastly. People die everyday for different reasons. All people die eventually. Some will die early because they were not prepared.\nI live my live in such a way that when I\'m done, I don\'t want to blame anyone. My rule is: It\'s not what happens to me that is important, but rather how I respond. This way, I don\'t rely on luck to stay alive. I wear non-slip shoes. I drive a full time 4x4. And I don\'t have a gun anymore. . . . . I got rid of it when I left the desert and moved to the city. I have a child and it makes me nervous to have a gun in the house.

I have heard that \"if you outlaw guns only outlaws would have them\" this would be true without the effective plan to eliminate them, but given time and the willingness to learn to live in a society without having readily available firearms, it would eventually come around to where no one had them.

That\'s when the random murders happen. \"Oh, I think I see Bob with a gun, I have to run him over with my car for the safety of the public.\" An anti gun \"task force\" of angry citizens will form. Anyone with a gun, or probably has one (wearing a suspicious trench coat) will be beaten until they give up their guns. But, gun violence will be gone, so everyone wins.'),(546424,'You misquoted me.\nHow do you explain the lack of gun violence in these confrontations in America.\nWas your question. My answer was that these areas with no gun violence have no guns in them. You said I must be crazy, I think a person who thinks that when two people get into a fight that they won\'t use whatever they have to win, is crazy.\n\nAnd again you misquoted.\nI said a school is a gun free zone. If schools openly allowed guns, then when any fight breaks out, a gun will be used.\nThe rest is all an attempt to belittle me, great logic by the way, and I don\'t even see a reason to respond to that.\nAlso for future reference, if you want to sound intelligent, don\'t misquote people, it\'s not helpful to your cause.'),(546425,'I didn\'t mean to, after all it was a copy paste. I meant that in America it is possible for basically anyone to have a gun on them. People don\'t shoot people because they know it is wrong to shoot people, and eliminating gun free zones will not change that.\n\nLET ME SHOUT SO YOU CAN FINALLY HEAR ME. WHY DON\'T WE SEE THIS ANYWHERE?\n\nHOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT THE SHOOTINGS HAPPENED IN A GUN FREE ZONE?\n\nYou have absolutely no reason to believe this. It doesn\'t happen anywhere, why would it suddenly start happening. Eliminating gun free zones means arming TEACHERS, not the students. I don\'t think the teachers will be getting into fights.\n\nOnly part of it was meant to belittle you. You have no reason to believe that what I said won\'t happen, if we assume that what you think will happen is possible.\nIf YOU want to sound intelligent you need to stop using insane impossible situations that would clearly be happening if you were right that they were possible.'),(546426,'Possible doesn\'t mean that everyone does, it means that everyone can. Make no mistake, if everyone did have a gun on them, gun violence would increase as any minor dispute, moved to a hot enough temperature could involve the use of their firearm. It\'s the reason when you fight in a public place, people get slammed onto floors, knocked over chairs, pushed into objects. People, in the heat of the moment, will often do whatever it takes to win the fight.\n\nObviously you\'re not reading me.\nIn a fight, whatever can be done to win, will be done.\n\nThat quote that you answered to, wrong. The shooting happened because one person didn\'t follow the rule, no one said gun free zones would eliminate gun violence.\n\nYes, but if it\'s a place where anyone can bring a gun, then anyone that can get a license for it, will bring a gun their. The kids are more likely to use them. You think a kid will sit back and be bullied if he can pull a trigger and end it? I think not.\n\nSame for you.\n\nSo gang violence involving guns are insane impossible situations?\n\nGang violence does happen. It\'s very possible. Anyone that has a gun will more than likely use it if a dispute does break out.'),(546427,'Since when did abolishing gun free zones lead to everyone having a gun.\n\nObviously this is not true because we don\'t see it anywhere.\n\nThat is my point, gun free zones don\'t prevent gun violence, therefore there is no reason to have them.\n\nWe have restrictions on the age someone can own a gun. Those restrictions will not be lifted, you argument is invalid.\n\nCool, since it is evident that eliminating gun free zones has no negative side effects, you must admit that taking away guns will cause massive amounts of violence. Seeing as you believe my scenario is fully reasonable.\n\nYou are saying that if we eliminate gun free zones, every man, woman, and child will have a gun on them. I am not exactly sure how you can use gang violence to support your claim.\n\nGang violence usually occurs because gang members are always looking for a fight, it is not some regular dispute that just gets out of hand. Eliminating gun free zones will not cause more gang violence. Police reduce gang violence.'),(546428,'No one\'s saying they will, but if everyone does, then all disputes will be handled with them.\n\n(1),(2),(3) I could go on all day, just google fights, or go to youtube.\n\nThey limit it, if their was no law on drugs anyone that wanted to use, would use.\n\n18? Any 18 year old in high shcool, can buy a gun. WHen they get into a fight, they can use that gun.\n\nNo I\'m saying if we eliminate gun free zones, the people who carry their guns naturally will no have no reason not to carry them into these places.\n\nGang violence is supporting the claim that if people have guns, they will use them when altercation arrive.\n\nSo you think gangs stand for fighting? No, they are trying to make money. You think gangs like Bloods, and Crips? I think gangs like The Mafia. When they are having a deal with someone, they are not looking for a fight, but if one breaks out, think guns won\'t be used.\n\nTrue, gang violence will happen regardless, but eliminating gun free zones will allow more people to openly carry guns in more places, where if a physical argument happens, a gun will be used.'),(546429,'That is the scenario you are arguing.\n\nI don\'t have time to look at those right now, can you just tell me when the guns get pulled out so I can fast forward to that exact time? That would help.\n\nIt is basically illegal to use a gun pretty much anywhere. How does a less enforceable law prevent more violence?\n\n21 for handguns, sorry.\n\nThat is not the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since when did the presence of a gun cause someone to die. It is the USE of the gun. The gun being used is just as illegal, and it would be as illegal as carrying a gun in a gun free zone, until you start detecting for guns.\n\nThis is an example of a group of people who want to commit violence so they go get guns, not the other way around. It does not apply to you.\n\nI am really glad the Mafia will not bring guns into a gun free zone because they respect the law so much.\n\nYou have no reason to believe this is true. Plus, it is safer having people carrying guns currently. Note, those 2 statements are different.'),(546430,'I am saying that if the guns are in people\'s pockets they will use them!

That will be used if the situation calls for it!\n\nIf any dispute happens they will use them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nYou completely ignored my point yet again. The gangs like The Mafia are not abiding by the law, that was not the point, the point is that, The Mafia is just trying to do business, but when something goes wrong they have guns, and they use them.

All bold and italics so you\'ll actually read it.\nIf it\'s illegal to shoot people, and shooting people still happens, then why make it illegal? Because it lowers the number of people getting shot.

You have yet to quote me properly, so i\'d have to say it\'s you.'),(546435,'Fuck you, this has to be a false statement.\nIf we make a law that bans lollypops will that lower gun deaths, no.\nA law that bans guns in an area will mean that there will be less guns in that area.

Newtown is proof that gun free zones DON\'T reduce gun death, therefore you argument is wrong, you lose. The ONLY reason why people aren\'t gunned down in gun free or not zones is because shooting people is wrong/illegal.\n\nSorry Charlie, all of you scenarios were based on your opinion, not what actually happens in real life. You either made an outrageous statement or went too far and made other things legal that are not on the table.'),(546436,'Really? What are we children?\n\nMind me for saying it, but you\'re an idiot. If their is a law against suckers, their will be less suckers. If there is a law against guns there will be less guns. That is a fact, it\'s undeniable. Obviously some people will still keep suckers, and some people will keep guns, but their will be less. You even said that if it was legal to shoot people that shootings would increase, why does it not register with you that if it\'s illegal to shoot people that shooting will decrease?\n\nThere had never been a gun death there before this big incident, if it the gun free zones did not exist, people would carry them all the time whenever, and if any dispute had happened, the incident would have happened sooner.\n\nSo in real life, people don\'t do whatever they can to win a fight?

That was my point you dumb mother fucker. How does someone with your intelligence breath much less make \"arguments\"? Banning guns in gun free zones will reduce the number of guns in that area, not reduce the number of gun deaths, just like you have said. IT IS ILLEGAL TO SHOOT PEOPLE YOU DUMB PRICK. Banning lollypops and banning guns in special zones has the same effect on whether someone will use a gun. But, we know that if someone else is around with a gun they can stop the shooter.\n\nBalderdash is precisely why I disagree with you.

I tried to point out to you that everything scary about guns is illegal, so adding on the ban is false peace of mind.

The policy now is like telling people they can\'t have guns, with no method of ensuring that they won\'t. In fact that\'s literally what it is.'),(546471,'Your argument is faulty, there is no correlation between the two premises, but I\'m sure you knew that already.\nIt\'s not the fact that Murder is illegal that deters it\'s practice, it\'s the likelihood of getting caught and the harsh penalties that will inevitably ensue because of getting caught that factors into the criminal\'s decision to act or not.\nThis is precisely why looser/no gun control works as a crime deterrent while gun-free zones are an attractant to criminal activity.\nIt works as a crime deterrent because the potential punishment for committing crime just rose up to the death penalty, and the potential for getting caught also increases dramatically, because there are more \"police\" (armed civilians) around that can catch the criminal in the act and stop him (it\'s easier to catch a fleeing target who\'s wounded by a gunshot than one who is unharmed).\nWith gun control, a criminal has a better chance of getting away because there are fewer \"police\" around that could wound and catch him, and the penalty for getting caught is up to the courts, and most likely NOT the death penalty. Furthermore, in gun free zones, a criminal can wield considerable \"force of arms\" over the civilians with even the simplest of weapons (knife or pistol). Because the civilians have no method of defending themselves, and the police are way off somewhere else, a criminal can force compliance by threatening their life, and being able to back it up, whereas a place with armed citizens, the firepower is equal or favoring the citizen and the criminal runs the risk of injury or death by attempting to bring to bear his weapon in such an instance.'),(546472,'Hey, I could support that!

What original? You mean the Articles of Confederation? I\'m pretty sure they don\'t. And if you mean the US Constitution, you are just as equally incorrect. Don\'t try to lecture me on the US Constitution, I have a copy of it right right next to me on my Desk.\nYou are absolutely ignorant if you think the Constitution said that, and proved it when you state so matter-of-factly that you used google to find this out. The Document that actually says that is \"The Declaration of Independence,\" Which I also have a copy of on my desk.\nThe 14th amendment furthermore also states nothing of the sort relating to equal treatment, and you would know that if you had actually read what it says. It simply states that all people born or naturalized in the United States are citizens and afforded equal PROTECTION by the law and shall not have such protections abridged. That\'s not equal treatment.\nSo, you still haven\'t answered my question. I asked specifically where in the Constitution is states that \"all people must be TREATED equally.\"\nBeing treated equally and being created equally, are two very different things. As is being treated equally and having equal protection under the law, and if you don\'t understand that, I\'m afraid you might need to go back to English class.\nAs for teachers contract, I can point to no such thing, because we were discussing a hypothetical situation, not actual reality. However, in My State, we have \"right to work\" protection, which means either party of the job contract can sever the contract at any time for whatever reason they desire. There\'s no such thing as unfair dismissal.\nIn the hypothetical situation we are discussing, and in real life of course, all parties under contract would have provisions made into their contract stating that new policies would require a re-negotiation of the contract. So, obviously, when the school changes their policies, they offer the teachers re-negotiation under a new contract, otherwise if they disagreed with the new contract after negotiation, they would be free to leave employment.'),(546503,'Apologies, I see now that you\'re from the UK, so I can\'t expect you to have as capable an understanding of the US Constitution as an American Citizen should. I\'m sorry for the mistake. However, my point still stands.'),(546504,'Accepted now you understand my reliance on the internet on some things and I apologise for my sarcastic response below.'),(546505,'Equal treatment under law how does that not mean not having equal rights or not being treated equally, please explain as I am obviously of a lower intellect as you'),(546506,'Equal Protection, PROTECTION, under the law. Not equal treatment. That\'s the difference.\nEqual protection means that the laws are not unfavorably skewed to exclude you. What is critical to understand about the US Constitution is that it is intended to protect the natural rights inherently attributed to all people in the Declaration of Independence. Life, liberty, and property (the pursuit of happiness in attaining and using material goods and services).\nThis then means, in the context of equal protection, that all citizens of the US will be equally protected in their ability to exercise these 3 rights and all others subsequent to them, without coercion or interference by government.\nAnd what is necessary to accomplish that, is to ensure these rights can not be taken away except through the due process of law, which accounts for many of the Rights listed in the Bill of Rights, forbidding from government power to cut around due process (rights of the accused), infringe on liberty (freedom of religion and speech), and remain subject to the Sovereign People (right to bear arms)\nEqual protection then means that the due process of law shall not be altered for any party, nor shall the natural liberties people enjoy be infringed. In historical context, the 14th amendment came about because certain states were intentionally making requirements to vote which the newly freed previously enslaved negro could not possibly meet, such as high taxes and literacy tests. Thus denying them of their right as a citizen to vote, without due process. The negro was guilty of nothing but being different, and yet being denied their rights, hence, equal protection of rights granted by the 14th.\nEqual TREATMENT on the other hand, as you seemed to imply earlier, was to be mandated for everyone to practice. Everyone must be treated the same and granted the exact same things. No one can own more property than another, groups can not be taxed at different rates, subsidies must apply to all industries and all businesses in those industries, females must be able to work all jobs men can work, bathrooms can not discriminate by gender, all people must have a driver\'s license, etc. stuff like that.\nThe example you used: gay marriage (ignoring the complete misnomer there):\nYou said it is not equal treatment to prevent gays from being married.\nBesides the fact that marriage is not a right in the first place and thereby not subject to equal protection, it already applies equally to all citizens:\nAny unmarried male is permitted to marry any unmarried female, not too closely related by blood, or outside of statutory age limits, and any unmarried female is permitted to marry any unmarried male, within those same restrictions.\nThis does not prohibit gays from marrying at all. Any gay is perfectly legally permitted to marry any member of their opposite gender, just as equally as straight men and women are. The law makes no exceptions except statute age, blood relation, and current marital status. Blacks, whites, gays, straights, men, women, etc, they\'re all free to marry their opposite gender.'),(546507,'It is obvious to me now that I was causing confusion with my choice of words, I meant equal rights by treatment I meant no one should be getting preferential treatment due to gender, sexuality, colour etc, I didn\'t mean everyone should use the same kazy and no one should be allowed to own more stuff than another, what do you think I am some kinda Commie? :)'),(546508,'Democrat Liberal Socialist actually, based upon your views for gun control, gay \"marital\" unions, and your choice of words. As well as your complete ignorance of the US Constitution :P\nYes, I came to the realization that this might have been a misunderstanding as I tried to explain the differences. Yes, the US Constitution affords equal rights to every natural born, or naturalized citizen, and as such, they are treated equally under the law (or supposed to be anyway).\nSome laws are unfair, however, the majority of them don\'t explicitly infringe on the natural rights of We the People, so they\'re perfectly acceptable legally. Anything that is a legal benefit is not a right however, and does not apply under equal application, protection, or treatment of the law.\nBut, perhaps we should get back to gun control now...\nMore guns = less crime. :)'),(546509,'The more i\'ve pondered guns I can see that would be impossible to ban Guns in America and I am not totally anti guns but I do believe there should be stricter laws on ownership/background checks or the existing ones should be made stricter or be better enforced but if people are refused a gun they should be given the reasons why and be able to appeal. This might hopefully keep legal weapons out of the hands of idiots and the dangerous and prevent school shootings at least those done by the owners of legal weapons.\nI think the way to get workable laws in place is if sensible gun owners helped with coming up with sensible laws instead of knee jerk opposition to anything that anyone suggests and to be honest some of the idiots speaking up in defence of guns dont help the gun owners cause, one of the best things the NRA did was cut its ties with Ted Nugent but some of the stuff he was coming out with just made him look like a loon, to an outsider you see that and think if thats the best person they could come up with for a spokesperson the rest must be really nuts.'),(546510,'I should certainly hope it would be possible, but I\'m not going to put anything past these anti-gun proponents, because they are not going to stop if they aren\'t made to. To them, everything is a step towards total prohibition and confiscation of all guns. Once they have this step, because it obviously won\'t work, they\'ll demand another step, more restrictive than the last, and then another, until ultimately guns are banned entirely, gun production is relegated solely to the military, and every loose gun in the hands of a civilian that can be found is confiscated (or \"bought\" by the government). Because the ultimate goal here is power, and control, through government, over the people. Some of the lesser proponents might just be misguided or brainwashed into thinking it\'ll be good for reducing crime, but the ones with legislative power working for gun control, are in it for the control. That\'s all government has ever been about and will ever be since it\'s formation, more and more control, until it has absolute control. That is why We are explicitly granted the protection from infringement on gun possession by the second amendment. Once a nation is disarmed, it is only a matter of time before they will be ruled by a supreme dictator and an unmatchable army.\nThe only gun control I would support would be mandatory gun training, and prohibition for felons and the clinically insane.\nBackground checks won\'t help much, because no known criminal would attempt to acquire a gun legally (they would either steal someone else\'s legally acquired gun, or buy off a black market), and most spontaneous gun crime is committed by people who have not not committed a previous offense.\nSensible laws according to whom? IMO, anything that even remotely infringes on my right to own, and carry on my person (keep and bear), any arm of military strength (militia required for a free state) is unconstitutional, and should therefore be stopped. We\'ve already made numerous concessions to the anti-gun crowd, concessions that ought not to be made, and yet they keep requiring more and more.

There needs to be a reason to keep something over, and I think gun rights advocacy benefits far more from advancing those arguments than from reverting to an easy fallback of \"tradition\".\nI think it is non-intuitive to state that an \"attack\" on one amendment or right included in the Bill of Rights is an attack on all of them. Many of the founding fathers who drafted the original ten amendments did not even consider them to be a single body of rights but did view them as being separate.\nFurthermore, I do not think the arguments or evidence have been adequately provided to support the claim that the right to bear arms is not in fact \"broken\". I think that the concerns of anti-gun advocates have not been seriously addressed in a fashion that befits those concerns, particularly where the right to bear arms may be in direct conflict with the right to life (the latter of which I would argue trumps the former).\nFinally, to make my stance more explicit I am both a gun rights advocate and a regulation advocate. Just as we embrace the right to free speech but restrict it where it conflicts with the public interest so to should the right to bear arms be subject to restriction. There is no reason it should have special exclusion from the same considerations to which all other rights are subjected.'),(554430,'Okay, now I see where your coming from. That makes sense.

For example:\nThe recent Arab Spring shows that citizens with ak-47\'s can defeat tyrannical governments who have jets, bombs, rockets, and tanks. Look at Libya, Syria, and Tunisia. They are redesigning the middle-east. Our right to own weapons are integral for keeping our country free. You know why our government is so great? Because they know that we can overtake them.

For example:\nThe October revolution was done by a small minority that took the advantage. The majority of the population did not support the communists. Later, Stalin killed well over 15 million of his own people, who were banned from owning firearms.\nAncient Rome is a classic example. When the Republic was dissolved, Emperors took over. They used their armies without public consent to take over.\nFranco\'s Spain was taken over by an army coup from Morrocco. The majority held with the Republicans, but they didn\'t have the same military power as Franco\'s forces. Franco then put down local insurrections and abused the minorities like the Catalonians and the Basques, who were not allowed to have firearms.\nYou also have the problem of having the majority take overs that then abuse or murder their rivals.\nFor example:\nNazi Germany. That was a majority led takeover. The government banned the \"un-pure\" of having firearms. That led to the easy disposal of the Jews. Now you have Jews for the Preservation of Firearms.\nAlso, why are semi-auto weapons and expanded magazines (not clips, that is a whole other argument) the problem? That\'s like blaming a spoon for making someone fat. It is a tool. People choose to do what they want with that tool. The majority that own this are law-abiding citizens, while the very small minority of criminals give it a bad name. It\'s like the punishing whole class by not going to recess because one person was being mean. The teacher would just punish that one kid, not the whole class!

You gun nuts use the same broken arguments over and over.\n\"Well it wouldn\'t save everyone so don\'t do anything\" or \"uh spoon for fat... and uh what did the NRA tell me again.\"\nOkay, some people might or might not get their hands on an illegal semi-automatic weapon with 30 clips. But that crazy kid who just shot up that school wouldn\'t have. If his mom didn\'t have an arsenal he might of had a shotgun or handgun, and only killed 2 or 3 kids before killing himself.\nThat\'s the point. Smart regulation along with efforts to identify mental illness will save real actual people, lots of them, every year.\nBut no, you\'re more concerned about shadow governments, your too filled with fear of god knows what, so you won\'t listen to reason.\nYou gun nuts are so out of touch and fucking religious about your dumb weapons, it makes everyone else say, \"fuck these gun nuts then, they aren\'t dealing with reality.\"'),(554457,'So it\'s his mom\'s fault for being killed and him stealing her weapons? Let me give you an example.\nColumbine. The man walked in with a weapon, during the middle of the Brady Bill. According to her bill, he shouldn\'t have been able to do that. But he did. He killed many people because he had over 20 clips and magazines with him. A criminal isn\'t just going to say \"I can bring only one clip\". If he can\'t bring one with more than 10 rounds, he will just bring more. Now I totally agree with the mental illness problem, that needs to be an issue, but not regulation. If we can reduce the number of mental people out there, than why wouldthey want to go out and kill people? Fix the problem, not the tool he misuses.'),(554458,'Yeah in part. It is the mom\'s fault for having guns lying around her psycho son could get a hold of. Which is why background checks should include whether you have crazy people living with you. If I have a crazy teen to young adult living with me, I sure as fuck make sure there is no way they can get their hands on a gun. I have no idea what she was thinking. Denial about her sons illness, maybe she thought she could get all Dirty Harry if he went nuts, but whatever she was thinking she was wrong. And it is very possible that this tragedy did not have to be as bad as it was if there were something in place to limit her firepower or make sure her son could not get a hold of those guns.\nAnd you can\'t catch everyone, people fall through the cracks. The point is that less people will die with better regulation. That some will still die is inevitable, but less people dying is a good thing.

The government did a study during the old Brady Bill and found out that crime in general DID go down, but violent crime with guns went up as well as school shootings. I don\'t want that to repeat. I think what contributed to it were the gun free zones. I think that arming teachers who are willing could prevent shootings. The only thing gun free zones do is disarm the teachers. In high school and elementary schools, students can\'t carry arms because they are too young, but teachers can. I think if they want to, they should be able to carry and protect against criminals who will just ignore the gun free zone anyway.'),(554460,'\"I think that arming teachers who are willing could prevent shootings.\" We would have to train our teachers like Police Officers or Military personnel for this to be feasible. We’d have to pay for that training and there would need to be refresher courses and re-licensing periodically. If we didn\'t require training, the increased presence of firearms on school property would add to tensions between hormone-addled teenagers and teachers at their wit\'s end. Eventually, a disturbed student WILL bring a firearm to school. In the initial panic that would inevitably ensue, the potential for friendly-fire shootings would be significant. Yes, there would be a chance for someone to disable or kill the aggressor, but would more bullets be the best thing for that situation?\nLet’s assume for a moment that the original gunman was taken down fairly quickly; there still remains the likelihood that the confusion and panic following such an event would create subsequent dangers. If an armed person is wounded or killed, a panicked student would be able to gain possession of a firearm and have the potential to make a bad situation much, much worse. If the student began firing the weapon, they might then be mistaken for an accomplice when in reality, they are terrified and fighting for their life.\nTo arm the public as you seem to wish to, we would need gun laws much like Switzerland; the Swiss have no standing army, but the majority of males between the ages of 20-30 are conscripted into the militia and undergo military training, including weapons training. If such laws were enacted, I doubt very much Americans would see this as a boon to freedom.'),(554461,'If you have a trained teacher, then the worry about friendly fire is negligible. You don\'t need to train a teacher like the police or military. Every concealed carry holder is trained to know what is behind their target, and not to go in guns blazing like Rambo. 1 to the head 2 to the chest, or a dedicated pair to the chest reduces the risk of friendly fire as well as taking the assailant down.\nNow, the problem of a student taking a firearm and being mistaken and shot is hard to imagine. Every student, including I, is taught to hide in the corner of the classroom. The teacher would then face the door with their weapon and if the shooter comes through, there is no risk to the students of being shot unless the shooter kills the teacher. If the teacher takes down the assailant, they have control of the situation and can take control of the shooter\'s weapon. A student isn\'t going to rush to the weapon and take it.\nAs for training the teachers, a lot of schools, gun schools, and other organizations have offered to teach teachers for free. And if we offer the training to teachers voluntarily, then the teacher may pay for it themselves or the school might do it for them. Re-licensing is cheap. Now, a teacher who is at their wit\'s end probably shouldn\'t have a firearm in the first place. That\'s when records and back-ground checks will come in. They will probably be more stringent than usual due to the situation, so they will be more effective. Now the chance of an angry student trying to take a weapon would also be negligible. The teacher won\'t be carrying it on their person at all times. Most teachers that are allowed weapons keep them in a handgun safe, or in a central school safe.'),(554462,'Friendly fire is always a concern where live ammunition is being discharged. And, I don’t know how you feel, but I would not let my child attend a school staffed by teachers who only possessed concealed-carry permits. Common sense would dictate that going in “like Rambo” is a horrible idea, but there’s no way to predict how someone might react under live-fire. A seasoned gun-man with years of experience could still have his judgment impaired when his life is in danger.\nI understand that you’re taught to hide in the corner; I was as well. However, you cannot predict how certain individuals will react; this is a recurring flaw in your argument. Allowing teachers to carry weapons on school property allows for countless scenarios in which they are disabled, their weapon is lost, and a frightened individual could gain possession of that weapon.\nThe rest of your argument relies on the survival of faculty; something that cannot be guaranteed. As soon as one faculty member is killed, students in that classroom would most probably try and flee or gain control of a weapon. The only other option would be to face almost certain death at the barrel of the aggressor’s gun. This idealized scenario has little chance of fulfilling itself in reality.\nAs you said, a teacher at their wits end shouldn’t have a fire arm. But, the career of teaching is one that inherently has a great amount of stress that comes with it. A teacher with a clean back-ground check could actually have a mild emotional disturbance that is aggravated by the stress of being a teacher. The only measure that could be taken to combat this would be to require teachers to submit to compulsory psychiatric evaluations periodically, and that still leaves the possibility for someone to falsely represent their mental state.\nThe risk of allowing teachers to carry arms far outweighs any benefits.'),(554463,'I agree, friendly fire is always a concern. However, I still think that allowing the teacher to arm themselves is a better option than not letting them, and putting a sign in from staying no guns allowed which the shooter has never followed anyway. I also think that many people who own weapons have even more high-stress jobs than a teacher could. Private Security, Police, and construction are high stress environments. Now, I know you would say that the Private Security and Police have training. What I\'m saying is the training given to teachers would make them just as capable handling a firearm as a police officer. Police even encourage training for concealed carry. They approve. And if a Faculty member is killed, then it is the same situation if the faculty member had no firearm at all. If a faculty memeber dies, then another must contain the situation, or a student may be able to also. I know there are a lot of risks, but there are risks for almost everything we do in life. I say arming teacher benefits outweigh the risk.'),(554464,'I agree that criminals aren\'t going to follow the law, however we shouldn\'t make it easier for them to access weapons.\nEarlier I stated that teachers should be trained as if they were police-officers; you\'ve almost agreed with me on that point. I would not want a teacher to be trained to the same level as average citizens; I would want them to be more capable with that responsibility. Simply possessing a concealed carry permit doesn\'t make someone a master-gunman; it takes an emotional fortitude and clarity of mind to assess and react to dangerous situations involving live fire.\nHow is a faculty member is killed and not having a fire-arm in the first place equitable in any way? If they had no fire-arm, and were killed, there would not be another fire-arm for the aggressor to use or for another student to obtain.\n\"If a faculty memeber dies, then another must contain the situation, or a student may be able to also.\" And now, you\'ve condoned students trying to \"contain\" a situation that will very probably get them killed.\nYou may say the benefits outweigh the risk, but careful investigation would prove otherwise.'),(554465,'Now, the way most average citizens are trained is very good. To be able to have a concealed carry permit, you must pass a test done by the Police department. I think if the Police approve, the carrier is well trained. A teacher receiving the same training would be very good, and would be able to defend themselves and their students.\nNow, I did say that a student may be able to control the situation. If he is being faced down by the shooter, any way the student can defend themself is justified, including picking up the weapon and firing back. What I disputed was that students who gained a weapon who were scared and over reacting would be a danger by running around and shooting. They absolutely can, but I don\'t see it happening. The way a school is controlled during a lockdown would prevent this from happening.\nYour argument about not arming teachers because if the teacher is killed there is no weapon for the shooter to use is, I think, I little absurd. The shooter came prepared. Either way he is going to shoot and kill people. If a teacher is killed without a weapon, then the shooter just keeps going. If a teacher is killed that was armed, the shooter may pick it up. But either way he is still going to kill. I would rather have the opportunity of a good guy, be that a student or another teacher, to be able to pick up that gun and kill the assailant than letting the shooter just keep going.'),(554466,'There are non-lethal ways to control the situation; anything else is unnecessary.'),(554467,'Why should we go non-lethal when the criminal will not give the same courtesy?'),(554468,'So he can stand trial like any other American citizen; death does not restore life.

The price of such a right is this: less crime over-all, more fatal crimes, and of course, more fatal accidents. Yet, I don\'t want to live in a police state where ONLY the police and the army have weapons.\nI will say this: people who own or carry guns need to be stable, mature, rational people. Of course, there is a lot of power in those who would be deciding WHO is psychologically sound enough to own and carry a weapon. Just know that the police have just as many accidents with weapons as the general public.'),(554472,'I disagree that guns protect US citizens from a police state.

Can\'t imagine anyone \"designing\" a civil society would want such a situation to be possible. Yes, I know someone could still stab you, etc, but they have to be next to you, get bloody and you have good chance of surviving. Also, knives have specific utility in the society (very high utility I might add) besides killing things.'),(554479,'Your argument is presented as a preference of how you would rather live, and that preference is based on fallacious logic that if a person can use something to kill you easily, no one should be allowed to have it.\nSo following your logic, we should not be allowed to have cars either, because at any moment, some one can drive on to a sidewalk and run you over.'),(554480,'It\'s true that other things in society can kill you but there are differences. A car has huge utility outside of running people over. This makes it impractical to even be considered as something to get rid of, so I don\'t.\nWhile it\'s true that at any moment a random person could run you over, maybe resulting in death, that\'s just \"bad luck\". They could have chosen anyone, they chose me. However, the case I don\'t like is where for example I fire a bad employee and they decide to use their \"kill button\" to \"settle the score\". They could try and run me over but that is much much harder because, I have to be walking someplace that A car can easily reach, where I won\'t notice the car coming, etc. The ease of being able to kill a specific person (or a group of people) with a gun is much higher than with a car.'),(554481,'Your logic is still fallacious.

They provide food for some people still to this day and they provide protection for others.\nMy mother was kidnapped when I was two and barely escaped with her life, she now legally carries a pistol at all times, as do I.\nSo again, lets show the fallacy of your logic, you now say a car is different because its harder to kill someone with it. Ok, well a knife is a universal tool needed for cutting and cooking, but yet it can be used to kill. It can actually be just as easy to kill, maybe even easier, because its quieter and easier to get than a gun.

It\'s dumb.'),(554483,'The 2nd amendment doesn\'t say you have to be in a militia to keep and bear Arms.\n\nBeing able to defend yourself against an attacker with a gun isn\'t utterly unnecessary.'),(554484,'The two most common arguments seem to be that firearms protect us from an oppressive government, and that people who want to will find a way to murder whether or not guns are legal. I will address both of these points separately.\nFirst, firearms do not protect against a tyrannical government. The US makes up 40% of the international military spending. Privately owned guns are not going to stop it if it wants to take away rights. Also, there is no historical precedent of firearms creating more freedom. The US is the only developed country without strict gun laws. European countries are just as free, if not more free than the US.\nSecond, people who really want to murder somebody aren\'t going to be stopped, whether or not other people have guns. After some research, I can\'t find any solid examples of armed civilians stopping a shooter. There are possible examples, but I believe that most of them are too unclear to accurately determine whether the shooters would have killed more people. Also, murderers will find a way to kill people. Armed civilians won\'t stop them. I believe that people who spend time planning a murder will also plan how not to be shot while doing it. Finally, banning guns will stop the unplanned, spur-of-the-moment killlings. The people who are mad and pick up a gun to shoot someone won\'t be able to kill. The people who wake up and decide to rob a gas station won\'t be able to kill.\nAnother common pro-gun point is the Swiss and Israeli models of gun control. The common idea of Israel having extremely deregulated guns is an outright lie. Switzerland is more complicated, though. Every citizen has a gun, but they are not privately owned guns in the same way American guns are. Every Swiss who is able to work in the military is required to, and during their service, they get a single unloaded gun to keep at their house. The lack of mass shootings in Israel is the result of a crackdown on terrorism, and I\'m not sure what causes a decreased number of shootings in Europe, but it is likely a mix between guns being less available and a culture that does more to deter shootings.'),(554485,'If you couldn\'t find any, here are some:\nPearl High School, Oct. 1st, 1997\nLuke Woodham goes into the school and kills two students and injures several others. The principal retrieves a .45 pistol from his truck and confronts Luke. Luke runs to his car to escape but is prevented by the principal, who holds Luke until police arrive.\nIn 2010, a man entered an AT&T;store in New York and started firing. A customer with a concealed carry drew their .40 revolver and shot and killed the shooter.\nAt the Clackamas mall in Portland, Oregon. A shooter with a rifle walks into the mall and opens fire and kills 2 people. A man with a concealed carry permit draws his weapon and confronts the shooter. When the shooter sees him, he turns the weapon on himself and commits suicide.\nThere are plenty more, you just need to look. I would like to address your points and offer my counter-points.\n1.The US may have the best military, but that still does not give them the right to ban guns. If we rebelled because they did, they wouldn\'t be able to wipe is out. For a modern example, look at Syria and Libya. Both governments had jets, bombs, rockets, tanks, and more weapons than the citizens did. However, the Libyans won their war and the Syrians have the capital surrounded. Both governments have lost, to citizens with firearms. They can get rid of a tyrannical government.\n2.Now, if guns are banned, they will still be used in crimes. Look at Britain, where it is illegal to carry a firearm, yet they are still used in crime. According to the law, the criminal shouldn\'t have one. But criminals don\'t follow laws. Also, the point you made on prevented mass shootings as not very good examples because it was not proved that the shooter might have killed more is wrong. The shooter didn\'t kill more because he was prevented! How can someone judge that he was going to kill more if he doesn\'t state so or is captured? He was either killed before he could murder more or was held by an armed citizen. The criminal can still buy a weapon if so chooses. However, he now has to buy it illegally, while the law-abiding citizen can\'t own one anymore.

My grandpa heard him and turned around with a 12 guage. The man frozed. The man has a rock and was about to bust my grandpa across the head. This isn\'t uncommon. Many people have been knocked cold, mugged, and their bodys thrown into the river. After a long silence, the man spoke up and said, \"he has a gun\".

People since the beginning of time have killed people. It will continue too. People can kill others by their bare hands. Why ban guns when it won\'t solve the problem.\nHow hopeless is that?! You are against the removal of a highly efficient murder-weapon, purely because people from the past can kill people, and punching up people seems to be worse than a gun shot wound, and instant death.\n\nFists are avoidable. You could run at any time... the same doesn\'t apply to guns. Also, gun wounds, hurt like hell. Worse. And I\'d better have my chances in hospital with punch-wounds instead of bullet wounds.\n\nI\'ve known a person who was shot in the stomach, along with thousands of stories about gangs, and driveby shooting. Have you not even considered the school shootings? Without access to their parent\'s firearms MANY people would of lived to this day. Being beaten up takes a while you know... and you\'d get over it in hospital to recover and live your life. Do not compare guns to fists... the wars between guns and melee weapons (Native indian against guns) ALWAYS ended with the death of the side that had no guns.\n\n\nYou are brazenly incorrect. When people/security come, they will run and separate the two. With guns, it would be more of police taking pictures of your dead body. Have you not seen the random punch ons that end with the security separating them appart? Have you not seen that when guns are involved, it turns into a full hostage situation?\n\n\nCare to show me those statistics? In Australia (where guns are illegal) we seem to have a considerably lower murder rate than all the gun wielding countries.\nAnd about the anecdote of your grandfather, those situations do not happen as virulently as school shootings and town massacres. Your grandpa may have survived but the hundreds of children who were shot dead in the multiple school shootings that occurred due to access of firearms, and the hostage situations involving guns could of been stopped, had guns not been easy to obtain.'),(771246,'As said before, you can\'t judge me when you don\'t even know me. Get off the emo crap.\n\nIt is sad, but it\'s the truth. You cannot deny that.\n\nA gun is not a murder weapon. It is also used in hunting and shooting competitions. However, since you want to elaborate on a \"murder weapon\", as said before, criminals will ALWAYS get their hands on a weapon or gun somehow. Gun control isn\'t going to solve anything.\n\nHave you ever seen someone get jumped? It happens so fast you don\'t have time to react. Usually, it is with a group of people too. As said before, criminals will always get weapons.\n\nGun wounds do hurt like hell. But if someone was going to pick a fight with me, I\'m going to tell them straight up. If they continue with that I\'m going to take every right ot defend myself.\nIt\'s not what you think. Here in the US no one just walks up and shoots the other guy. It happens for a reason. Just like a fight happens for a reason. It\'s not at random.\n\nHere in the US it has changed. Most big schools that occurs in now requires you to go through security checks. Most schools now have a lot of police officers with tasers and sometimes lethal weapons. These school shooting could easily been stop by this. Sadly, the didn\'t react fast enough.\n\nNot when you die from it. Thats were I\'m getting at.\n\nThats another thing I touched on. As said a hundred times, criminals will always gets guns.

Search some facts and get back to me if you would like to debate on the massacare thing.'),(771247,'Even if I don\'t know you, your words give some kind of idea. That\'s why I said \"Seem.\"\n\nI\'m not denying that. I\'m saying it sounds hopeless because you all of a sudden believe that banning guns won\'t solve the problem- when it clearly could.\nIf you were at war, in a world where guns didn\'t exist, only like 10 people would die instead of 10,000. Guns are like nuclear weapons compared to fists- that is undeniable.\n\nA gun is a freaken murder weapon. Just because you could \"hunt deer\" and shoot in competitions doesn\'t invalidate the fact that you could also use it to kill people. Are you so blind as to ignore all the homicides in the news where people have been killed with guns? How dumb can someone be to decide to ignore the fact that guns could also quite rather be a highly efficient murder weapon compared to fists? You are shooting a poisonous, searing hunk of lead at a thousand miles an hour, straight into the vital organs of a human being, and then merely placing another magazine in to do it again to another person within a split second. Something no fist can match.\n\nOh, so security guards don\'t exist now? So one punch means you\'re dead? So when someone comes up to punch you, you would have much of a better chance of escape when the person has a gun because bullets are way slower and weaker than fists? Who would think that?\nAnd concerning that matter about how criminals could get their guns anyway, removing the damn gun shops would sure as hell LESSEN the availability of guns for these criminals. Is that not good?\n\nNot everyone is you.\n\nMental disorders/ Anger problems exist. This is what drives serial killers most of the time. And not everyone is the same. Also, during conflicts, innocent people could be killed, like in gang wars, or hostage situations. Also, with the accessibility of ranged weapons on the market, armed robberies become more common, and more things have been efficiently stolen as everyone was too scared to be shot.\nAnd anyway, if you pissed off some guy either intentionally or unintentionally, wouldn\'t you prefer he express his anger by punching you up(at a point where someone could break it up), instead of placing a bullet in your head without any chance of retaliation? I don\'t know what rock you were living in but fatality rates with guns are way more higher than fists.\n\nBut they wouldn\'t of been needed to spend money on this damn protection without the shockingly high accessibility of guns in your country. In my country, we don\'t need that because we hardly get any school shootings.\n\nBut what you need to understand is that there are multiple factors that make this irrelevant in real life; such as public or authoritative intervention, self defense, and evasion- none of which apply when guns are involved.\n\nAs I have said before, removing the availability of guns would lessen the chance of armed criminals. They would have to work harder to obtain them, and have brains and Intel to access the black market. This would mean that potential serial killers, who aren\'t informed and wealthy enough to get access to the black market are canceled out, and no one would be murdered by them as much. See? It lessens things... don\'t you want those chances to be lessened?\nAnd I mentioned war do demonstrate the destruction of guns, compared to fists.\n\nWhen someone bursts into your house, when no one else is around, they will most likely kill you if they have a gun. If they just burst in with melee weapons, you could most likely escape, if you understand the chances. And also, not all fist fights occur in homes; they also occur on the streets where people could intervene and stop them. This doesn\'t apply to guns, because people would be too scared to be shot.\n\nThe \"trusted\" statistics from your lonely, shady source is a little unspecific. It only shows accounts of violence- not concerning fatality. Unfortunately, alcohol abuse is a large problem in my country, so violent attacks would be common. But that\'s just culture, and in those multiple attacks, at least the victims involved survived in hospital straight after. But in America, fatality is high within the small percentage, due to weapon usage, as bullets tend to kill. But that fatality can be considerable lowered, so people could walk out of hospital alive.\n\nI find you hard to believe. Why in the hell would a country where mentally challenged criminals could buy their guns from a shop at any time have more violent shootings? How about you search up the facts. I\'ve read too much about school shootings to know that the people involved who shot the place bought their guns from the local gun shop. The facts speak loudly that you are brazenly asserting nonsensical things. You go now and hug your guns.'),(771248,'Any Federal gun regulation I am against. It makes little sense to give the Federal government the ability to regulate gun ownership to an individual level.\nI believe that it\'s okay for the States to require gun registrations. I don\'t exactly believe that it\'s a must, but to me it\'s truly up to the States and local governments to decide for themselves. I would not demand that the Federal government goes the other way and restrict the ability for States to register gun ownership.\nHowever, I find any gun bans to be Unconstitutional and ineffective.'),(771249,'Disarmed People = Are Dominated People\nSimple as that so do we really want to ban guns?'),(771250,'I like the current system in England. It means we have less people running around shooting eachother willy nilly.\nNormally I am pro rights on most matters, but the thing about guns is that their one and only purpose is to kill shit. Yes, you can go clay pigeon shooting (which is fun), but that is just to simulate killing real pigeons, (which taste a lot better).\nIt doesn\'t mean you can\'t own a gun, it just means you can\'t own a gun for the wrong reasons. It\'s quite clear that, if more people have guns that are allowed to be left lying around, more accidents will happen, and crimes of passion will be easier. Just check the gun crime rates of Britain against America.\nAmerica firearm related death rate: 10.27\nEngland/Wales firearm related death rate: 0.46\nYou can\'t argue with the numbers, gun control saves lives.'),(771251,'Well I\'m not for complete control nor complete ban but making it harder for people to get a gun legally makes it harder for them to be sold illegally seeing as there wouldn\'t be as many guns to go \"missing\". I think something along the lines of a yearly check in or something with the police to prove you still have your gun would help stop people selling them when needing cash. Guns are tools and in the right hands are used for fun as in target shooting or for food like hunting (I do not condone trophy hunting, if I kill something I will eat it and use all I can from it). Anyway, a full banning would make it harder to track guns because you will have a greater black market as well as those stupid enough to make their own ( which isn\'t that hard). My point is lets keep them but make them them harder to lose track of with more checking and better ideas of customer demand, why build more guns than they sell? As for military weapons, don\'t have so much trust in single people, better teams are the solution. Two or more people are harder to bribe or keep quite compared to one checker.

Way too simplistic.'),(771339,'Hate to sound like a redneck but hell yea we need guns here. Knowing that police and military are the only ones with guns in no way makes me feel safe. The first thing every dictator does is take away the guns. If I want to kill someone and all I\'ve got is a pencil then I guess that\'ll have to do. It\'s human nature and tyrannical laws won\'t make us any nicer, just more psychotic. P.S. I don\'t wanna hurt nobody.'),(771340,'Absolutely! Why would anyone in any country ever want to be unarmed when the government and criminals have them. I think that if a person or a society puts themselves in that position they deserve to and WILL be oppressed.'),(771341,'1. No one deserves to be oppressed. That\'s just douche baggery (I\'m coining that phrase, like buggery, but baggery being preceded by \"douche\").\n2. I don\'t have a gun, and I\'m not oppressed at all. Arguably I\'m less oppressed than most.'),(771342,'I don\'t own one either but the day someone tells me I cant is the day I get one and kill anyone who tries to take it away.'),(771343,'Ah, the old angry insane gun nut mentality.\nKill anyone who takes my gun... uh, even though I don\'t have a gun.\nDo you feel this is a normal reaction?'),(771344,'Are you telling me that if the government (or anyone for that matter) told you that you couldn\'t have a gun, they could but you couldn\'t weather you wanted one or not, you wouldn\'t be angry? I don\'t need someone telling me that I cant defend my self and my family the way i find appropriate. The day someone tells me that I\'m supposed to fight off robbers, rapists or child abductors with a knife, and some mace only is the day that person and whoever they represent becomes my enemy and my oppressor and I\'m not just gunna let them do it.\nYes i don\'t own a gun but my husband does and if he didn\'t then I would own one.\nThere are people around the world living in fear of their government and extremest. Worried that any day at any time someone could come and take everything they have and everyone they love and they wont be able to stop them because all they have are rocks and sticks for weapons. I known that we are lucky in this country, that reality doesn\'t exist in our daily lives but it could and the first steps towards it is taking away our ability to stop it.\nI phrased my previous statement the way I did to get a reaction but it doesn\'t mean its not true.'),(771345,'Meh,\n1. I suppose if we\'re talking dreamworld where someone is actually trying to take guns away from law abiding citizens for some nefarious reason, okay kinda\nI notice a false storyline where people pretend legislation to ensure an AK is only sold after a background check and where any dissent to laws like stand your ground are met with wild-eyed predictions of some coming Apocalypse.\nSo that\'s kinda the atmosphere I\'m replying from.\n2. Most have a better chance of surviving any robbery or the like, where the perpetrator has a gun, by not trying to pull one them self.\nDespite all of our imaginings otherwise, very few of us are Dirty Hairy.\n3. Of course I\'m a ninja, so I don\'t need one anyway :p'),(771346,'What\'s the point of this debate people are just gonna. Rake the laws anyway'),(771347,'Sure, but really there should be more extensive tests and trials before giving any random person a gun.\nI don\'t trust people as much as some do. Not that I don\'t trust people at all, just that considering the circumstances and events that have happened oh since the birth of America, I have my reasons to not trust every American, why should I?\nSo really this is about trust, rather that potentiality of \"guns in america\".\nAt the top of my head I cannot think of regulations and/or tests that should be given in more extent before handing a person a weapon for no good reason.'),(771348,'I live in Australia and no one except mainly the police have guns...\nAnd we\'re doing just fine. Of course there are some ways where criminals could get their hands on em, but that is uncommon.

Otherwise, why would you have the government support a culture of violence? Ideally, there is no reason to carry firearms, and there is no demand in the black market. If this can\'t be achieved then selling legally is a good temporary fix.'),(771374,'Yea, i agree, they should only be sold in dark alleys on the black market to all sorts of criminals who would still be able to buy them, and then the people who abide by the law will have no guns to protect themselves from criminals because theyre not familiar with this type of purchasing.\nNow see, me, i like to have a little fun on the \"dark side\" so id buy myself a gun for self protection, i bet i could get a great deal on the streets'),(771375,'yes, this is a good point, although i think they should not be sold in dark alleys for criminals, just for the military forces and police'),(771376,'Well see thats the point: theres always going to be an illegal market for things that are illegal.\nOnly allowing armed forces to have guns would be terrible and if that happened there would be a massive power split and civilization would fall to pieces'),(771377,'Even if we ban them, how can we make sure that people will not buy it from an arms dealer. Guns can easily transferred from the Mexican Border like drugs and people. These firearms are much more deadly.'),(771378,'in the U.K. there are no guns sold over the counter. this means are crime rate is slightly lower then the U.S. i\'m sure if you came and lived in the U.K. you would see what i mean. now imagine if no criminals could get hold of a gun, you wouldn\'t need a protection, as no criminals have guns. if no citizen had guns, just the forces who know how to properly use it, then we would need to guns for protection, just for war. if no guns can be sold over the counter, less are going to be sold, less are going to be made, and we will be saving millions. not to also be saving materials for what we really need. special modified guns could be given to animal hunters and fishermen, maybe so they only work on certain animals, so they wouldn\'t be able to kill anything other then that animal. but imagine, if not so many animals were killed with guns, those animals have a right to live. selling guns over the counter means that ANYONE can have guns to just display, kill animals or \'protect themselves\'. think like the U.K. snd you will soon see what i mean..... and if you are not a women, or more, still in school, change how you think for this debate, and think how i think, and debate. NO GUSN SHOUDL BE SOLD OVER THE COUNTER IN AMERICA. SEE THE U.K.\'S CRIME RATE GO DOWN!'),(771379,'Can you explain how then will the American people will the firearms and may I ask would this be considered unconstitutional by the 2nd amendment.'),(771380,'still, i don\'t get what you mean by 2nd amendment. THE POINT IS THEY DO NOT GET GUNS. ANYOEN CAUGHT WITH GUNS WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO SHOW VALID PROOF THAT THEY CAN BE ARMED WITH A GUN WOUDL BE SENT TO PRISON, OR WORSE, FOR LIFE/KILLED.

Sold over the counter? Absolutely.'),(771391,'the right to own a gun is one of our most basic freedoms here in the U.S. Criminals are not the only people that own guns. it isnt the gun that kills people, its the person that makes the stupid decision to pull the trigger. owning guns also allows us to protect ourselves. even if we did outlaw guns. criminals would still get a hold of guns illegally. the only difference would be that citizens would not be able to protect themselves'),(771392,'How would people get guns to go duck hunting? '),(771393,'well, first, they wouldn\'t. you are killling harmless creatures. and if you had to you coudl have a special shop selling animal guns.'),(771394,'then how would they be sold?

One of our basic rights as Americans is the Right to Bear Arms. This isn\'t just so we can own guns to hunt with and protect ourselves, but to also protect from a tyrannical government. If the government and armed forces were only those with arms, who will protect citizens when the government is tyrannical? Don\'t think for a second it can\'t happen here in the US. It already is.'),(784003,'Yes Private property or not i do beileve we should be able to carry anywhere.....why?\nBecause well in my case the Indiana State Police Department has deamed me capable of carring a hand gun.'),(784004,'Not that their killing machines, but property rights are part of individual rights. You have a right to carry a gun, but if an owner of property asks you to leave because of your weapon, you must leave. It is not up to you what goes on on someone else\'s private property.\nPublic sector, however, should be fully open to the carrying of firearms.'),(784005,'I think it is a dangerous concept to allow people with guns in business establishments.');
